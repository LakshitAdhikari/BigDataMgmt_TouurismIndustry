When we talk about Big Data there are many ways to define Big Data and one of the ways in which we can define Big Data, if this works in the end is we can talk about data flows that we work on in real time to make decisions, as Jose said, the Pica has been installed for a long time in many of the industries and tourism is not an industry alien to this type of movements, in fact and there are companies that are working on the incorporation of Big Data To develop new services that you have, for example, known in the sector already used, you are to try to extrapolate and know 7 days before it occurs what are going to be the variations of the prices of the flights Google every time we search for a destination, what it does is processes that information adds it and is able to offer through a service such as destination trains that you see here in advance what are the most searched destinations, what is the desired form of transport to use those destinations And therefore it is able, by adding the information of all of us, to anticipate which are the most desired cities to go on a trip, probably interesting information for destinations, companies such as Disney are using a My ICPLUS bracelet that they take to people who not only go to the parks but sleep in the hotels and is able to have real-time information to be able to redesign the park, redesign the flow, redesign where to place, for example, the food carts etcetera, etc. these are still approximations to big data, as José said before, from a perspective more of the companies that have data and processes, but would like to raise another issue, would like to focus on the look more from the point of view of the destiny of the city, of the country with that data and based on these headlines that are behind are not headlines that tell us, for example, that Spain receives 37 million tourists and they dare to say that this is the case. It is 13.7 percent more than the previous year to La Vanguard tells us that one out of every four foreign tourists who landed in Catalonia One out of every four tourists who gave away in Spain out in Catalonia and my question is how do they know how Barcelona is able to know and say that have received 13 million tourists who do have someone at the door of Barcelona counting the cars that enter and seeing that in each car there are 3 people has someone the airport with a counter counting how many people get off the plane have someone next to Erivan saw to see how many people have signed up for the derby website to me to come to Barcelona or they are dedicated to throwing dice to know exactly how many are the citizens the things that have come the answers that they don't know the answers that there is no destination today that in real time is able to know or is knowing how many tourists have basically the headlines that have seen if The searches are obtained from statistics of the hotel sector, from data from the airlines, from data from the railway companies, which are obviously the sum of data from which extrapolations are made, but the relevant question is, if they could know, and if a destination could know in real time, how many people at that same moment are at that destination, for example, if Barcelona could know how many people there are and where they come from, they could know if their website has to be used. Do it in English because many English people come, in French because they hear French, or in Russian because there are many Russians If you could know in real time where tourists come from and you could know what kind of hotels they prefer, you could decide what kind of hotel licenses it offers now that Barcelona is already reviewing a moratorium on hotels, you could decide what kind of hotels to open or, for example, you could know where to invest, you could know which fairs to go to look for tourists because yes or yes in time Real which are the tourists who come to my city, can decide where to invest my income in fairs, can decide where to invest my money from the point of view of advertising media, can say if put more investment in a new in another or can even decide what kind of services design, so if had that information in real time could do it and the question is how can get it well three years ago or so next to telephone and had tried to Obtain that information using Big Data as a source of information What you are going to see here now is in no case statistically representative, among other reasons because what we did was to capture two types of data, the first data was the roaming of the phones when a person with a non-national phone enters Spain because only the telephone operators know in real time when a foreigner enters Spain, in fact they are the only ones who can know it, roaming is activated if you go Between October 7 and 21, 2012, we used 700,000 foreign phones and 200,000 operations carried out with credit cards used through the Debehobia terminals to be able to know in real time what was happening with these people basically what we did was to exploit the big data generated by those two types of data sets types of data sources to try to draw conclusions that would allow us to make decisions, repeat what you see and what we will see now and what we will talk about are obviously anonymizing data, am not interested in knowing if François is coming or Fredrik is coming from France, am interested in knowing what the French do when they are in Barcelona or when they are in Madrid and that does not violate the data protection law and what want to know is where they move in the future. Whether when they do an event with their phone, what they did with some of the antennas or when they pay with a card for a POS terminal, am able to know where they have paid and for what amount and with that can be able to know in real time and try to determine behaviors a little bit, what we are trying to say what we will see now is not so much a statistically representative data but a methodology from which to be able to make decisions and that methodology when we obtained it In the end we draw four major conclusions, the first big conclusion is that the important thing is not the big data, the important thing is the vision, the important thing is not the data itself, the data has no value telephone has had the roaming data of tourists arriving in Spain for years, the relevant questions you ask about that data that allows you to draw conclusions, for example, if am able to know thanks to the geo position of the phone where each of the people sleeps. For example, if this is the map of Barcelona, it turns out that the Portuguese are the non-national group that sleep furthest from the center of a city, 7 kilometers from the city center, and instead it turns out that people who come from Arab countries are the people who stay closest to the city center, with that information can try to decide for each group which one is The means of transport that can incentivize and can encourage the Bicycling can encourage the metro can encourage the bus can send them information at origin talking about the most appropriate means of communication for their means of transport can tell where to locate that investment for example if am able to know each of these nationalities that we study where they sleep can determine where is the best place to be able to place the hotels here you have for example a map of Barcelona where you see By nationalities where the different nationalities sleep, you can see most days sleep in the center of the city, a few sleep outside and curiously there is a set of neighborhoods of the city of Barcelona where these tourists do not spend the night on a regular basis, that is information, then the City Council, who leads to make the decisions, will be able to make the decisions, one decision may be to move hotels out of the city center to distribute it, the other can be to continue investing in the hotels within the city. city center etc. but the interesting thing is that have the ability to have that data to make decisions, imagine, for example, the issue of cruises so fashionable in our city, these are from the videos, this is an animation, if it works, an animation of the city of Barcelona where you can see what happens when the cruise ships arrive in Barcelona, you can see the port where the cruise ships are and what you see the balls that light up are the telephones, as and so. As they move through the city, as you can see in the morning, which is when the tourists arrive, these are twelve o'clock in the afternoon, basically they move near the port, as the day progresses, they begin to move and it is in the afternoon, just after lunch, when they move out of the areas near the port, and you will see how the Sagrada Familia begins to dominate much more and you will see how the center of the city is much more illuminated. As a city can make decisions about how to manage the taxi system, about how to manage the restaurant system, etcetera. The second conclusion of this methodology is that it is exactly what we ask of those who manage tourism, think that what we have to ask for is efficiency, what we have to ask is that the destination works is efficiency and that, therefore, what this destination decides is where to invest the resources that you have available here in a more efficient way, you can Produce the debate of what is the type of tourist that the city wants or what is the type of tourist that the city has, well with that information what you can know is what type of tourist you have and then you make decisions for example if am able to know here you have a map of Barcelona between 9 and 12 at night if you see the box that will appear now this is for citizens who come from Russia here you can As you can see, between 9 and 12 o'clock most of the Russian citizens are inside the city of Barcelona, on the other hand, if we look at what the Portuguese do in the same time slot, you can see that the Portuguese in that time slot are outside the city of Barcelona, which means that the Portuguese tourist either does not sleep in Barcelona because he only comes to spend the day, or if he sleeps, he sleeps outside the city or configures from the point of view of the city. efficiency of the city where to allocate the resources, for example, if am able to know, here you see the part of the citizens, you see this table, there are no marks in red, which are the ones that indicate activity of each of these nationals in this in this quadrant, clear, with that, cross-referencing the information of where each nationality is and they are with the card, can know each nationality when it invests in hotels for example, can know that the French spend 90 euros on hotels, that is equivalent if the We move to a three-star hotel we see that Russians spend approximately 120 euros, this is equivalent to a 4-star hotel and the Swiss spend on average about 186 euros, this is equivalent to five stars, repeat, care about the data, statistically that it is representative, what matters is that in real time you can know each nationality, how much it spends and what category it corresponds to, and then you as a city will decide, what type of tourist you are interested in, or in other words, where you are going to stay. The CIA can decide what a typical French tourist wants, with that average price rate and those hotels, a Swiss tourist, and therefore it can decide to go to a tourism fair in France or a tourism fair in Switzerland. can be measured and not that it invests money in a destination that may not be a country that is not the ones who want to come and visit us well, the third of the conclusions that we draw from this model is that there were intermediaries or intermediaries have explained that this is a study that we did for the cities of Madrid and Barcelona where we used data from Telefonica and data from BBVA to be able to draw conclusions as you have seen the phrase just said They do not appear in the word Barcelona City Council- in the Madrid City Council, that is, someone is intermediating the information Someone is intermediating the data in a way that the City Council could tell you have the data of what tourists do You want it answers and new answer that you give me in return the question is a city .A country a region has to mediate the data or should let someone else in between. A strategy for capturing data, well Telefonica has the capacity to do it by roaming Barcelona, it should have the capacity to sensor the city and maybe not with the same precision, but to be able to have information that allows it to make decisions in real time and not depend on a third party that we see very clearly in the tourism sector if we get out of big data and go and make a little history of the tourism sector when the Internet appeared and it turns out that the Destinations, hotels and others thought that the Internet would allow them to be an intermediary and would allow them to be able to directly sell their hotel nights, their restaurant reservations and therefore earn a better margin for that operation, well while the hoteliers were celebrating what the hoteliers to give us an idea, they are the ones that appear on the left of our screens, the traditional operators appeared the new operators, the ones you see on this side, no booking, for example, Bay shore drifts by For example, or Google later that what they did was to intermediate, while the hotelier tried to celebrate that there was finally no longer a travel agency and they could directly sell the hotel night, Booking appeared to intermediate them, they last hotel night and on top of that, they charge them a commission, today more than 50 percent of the hotel nights that are mediated on the Internet in Europe are done by Bookingo intermedias or someone is going to mediate with the experience of what has happened in The tourism sector in the hotel sector, more specifically, the question is, the destinations really want someone intermediate and the information for them, a destination really does not want to have the data to be able to make decisions, and the fourth reflection, the fourth reflection, is more related to as said before, the data by itself has no value the data from Telefonica has had it for years, the baby data has been the question for years, the issue is not only what question you ask What we have seen now makes sense in isolation but above all it makes sense together when know what nationality you are because follow the trail of the phone and know how much you spend in that hotel because have the card in some way when we talk about using data as a model to make decisions, the relevant thing is that other data sets that other data can have that can put together to bring more value to the one that is arriving here, for example, you have Again, this is a video of what Russian citizens do 24 hours a day in Barcelona, you can see now there will be some small red spikes that are again the indication of the phones when they are activated, here you have only the phone, here you will see, for example, that in the morning they are in the central part, you will see some little pike in the northern part, it is because there are Russians, many Russians who sleep on the coast, then you will see how they come to Barcelona, you will see how during the At noon it is in the part of the center it is in the Sagrada Familia you will see that suddenly there is a channel up those are all the Russians who go to Montserrata to see the Moreneta, they know that it is there and they go and the question is with that information that other data sets can gather to offer value that other information can gather here to offer value the railways and in the end the sum is the one that ends up providing that value and that is not the case. For example, in the study we saw no to the relationship that could exist, for example, between Madrid and Barcelona, someone has ever wondered, the tourist who comes to Madrid or who comes to Barcelona, where he has been before, we look at it, for example, it turns out that Americans, 37% of Americans, sorry, 38% choose Madrid as a destination, more than 50% originate Barcelona and only 4% choose both destinations. The question here is do we compete or cooperate if they are two cities that They promote tourism and capture it, the question is, can we establish alliances with the destinations that are closest to us to be able to make decisions and in the end make us all win more when, as we have seen, we use that data especially with the intention of first of all trying to answer the question of whether or not we could have information in real time to be able to respond to the destination, we realized that we could have information in real time to give an answer to the destination. At the destination, we realized that what was relevant, in this case, was not the data, what was relevant was the model that we were able to create and the challenges that we could launch to the destinations, so that with that data they could make decisions, where the important thing was not the important question, it was not the data, but the question, where the important thing was not what it spends, but that that expenditure is efficient, every euro that spend on tourism, that it is able to give back, that it is a destination that spend allow me to make decisions from the sum of datasets that allow me to take value. Therefore, the conclusion that we end up drawing and obtaining was basically big data from the point of view of tourism exploitation, it can be seen from a positive point of view, we are afraid of privacy we are afraid that our data will be breached, but what if the data is anonymized and with that data, we are able to make decisions that make us much more profitable as a destination we were ready to go later gentlemen good afternoon welcome to this session this is about smart tourism and we are going to spend some time talking about all the things that are happening in the future tourism is changing dramatically and we're in a position of start looking and gazing to the future for those of you who do not know me my name is Dmitri Collison professor of a tourism and the head of department of tourism hospitality in Bournemouth University we are hosting this event for many years in the world travel market and we are bringing some of them says that work we are doing out to the world travel market 've got a fantastic panel here from Mario Hardy who is the chief executive officer of Potter Richard Lewis from what three wards and the other company which don't remember right now development so tells thank you that's great then we have phase from trip face yes and then we've got we've got Eileen who is standing in for Jason who is stationed oxidation song who is sitting at the back with the managing director of draw from consuming timer and Eileen is going to do some of the presentation we may bring him up here later on 'm just going to go and the computer and do a very quick presentation for you to see what of the major developments that we see in in tourism guys if you can change the presentation and get mine first before Mario not this one hi guys sup the stage at the back can you see can you hear me otherwise we do it the other segment wake them up okay here you go so basically when we are talking about smartness a lot of people understand that smartness is kind of an evolution of technology but it isn't smartness is really about taking advantage of networks it's really about bringing the interoperability and interconnectivity of networks and engaging different technologies in order to maximize in order to maximize the value that's being created smartness really is about re-engineering the industry and taking advantage of the new systems that they're melting in the marketplace towards enable enabling real-time co-creation of experience it's based on in terms of things open data and big data and artificial intelligence and this a lot of the research that we're doing in form of university a lot of those things are engaging together in order to provide the value that's being co-created in real time with consumers when you look into the disruptive technologies of the emerging you'll see that you've got the Internet of Things you see that you've got artificial intelligence you see that you've got a whole range of rearranging the customer journey you see block chains you see collaborative economy you see a whole range of new trends that are bringing both strategic and disruptive realities and we believe the tourism in the future will be very different from tourism of the past the new smart traveller will be will engage in very personalized contextualized services that they will engage and explore they very idea around them they'll be living like a local for period of time and they'll engage with industry and any stakeholder who create value for them they'll be looking for authentic and immersive experiences and they'll be looking for technology to help them at each stage of their travel they'll be using a lot of user-generated content they'll influence a brand reputation and they'll have huge impact on the destination so the new traveller is going to be a smart reveller they'll be carrying at least one computer with them a mobile smartphone and they'll be engaging with everybody in the destination so this is so this is some of the latest research that we do so what happens is that you have got tourism suppliers creating all kind of data this data are going up on the cloud you use artificial intelligence and data mining in order to create value and you've got value aggregators who are engaging their process and then comes down as a storm of value to consumers providing personalized contextualized and individualized experiences it's a very different way of doing that in the old world of tourism this was taking months to prepare a minimum of one year now all that will be created very quickly because what's going to happen is that we'll know in real time where people are what kind of engagement they've got what kind of needs they've got and bring them together with suppliers in order to engage with us to do that we'll connect a lot of data that they'll be emerging from sensors obviously don't have a lot of time to go through all of that in detail and lot of the sensors will be we will be wearing them on wearables so we'll understand a lot of the things and they're your individual contacts as a customer when you're traveling around we will be looking to a lot of social media kind of data and we'll be data mining collecting data mining and processing that in real time and then this is from brain soils is looking to the conversation prism where we collecting all the data from wherever the day is we listen we engage we learn and we co-create and all that in real time so this is a very different way of creating tourism for those of you who are getting engaged in China so enough it has got the great wall so they've got the whole range of different social media that they're using time that we do not necessarily use in the West and equally they don't use some of our social media so internal factors in terms of what you like the goals and the preference and the tasks and external factors in terms of the season the light the traffic they are pressure delays location emergencies strikes all of those things are creating the contextual information and tourism will be co-created take into consideration the contextual information so this some of the publications will do have got we've done that on the one side you've got the traveller on the other side you have the travel extra allege district and in the middle you have got these platforms that they are supporting their mediation and here you have got the context influencing that but bringing a whole range of different products and services we have a lot of beacons that they're going to send things to us and we'll have management of the journey before during and after so we will we will manage the journey of consumers before during and after and particularly during the travel when people are still traveling they'll be able to communicate with different stakeholders engage information by doing that we will have interoperability of systems in real time we'll have technology as a means to an end not as a solution will enable Big Data in terms of things and open data we deliver value for marketing and all of that will be driven by agility keep saying that then every time 'm speaking about these things a lot of people are getting a little bit concerned about this is too much technology in fact it's not about technology it's really about agility it's really about understanding what's the need then if the need is bring a pizza is the pizza is coming to you because we know where you are we know where the destination is and keep saying that one of the most interesting things that happened to me was in can do when Jason had invited me there to talk in China about smart tourists and was into some dog hotel that the table maid left a little note for me saying since you are having a conference model give you a little bit of sweeties in order to protect your throat this is this is clever this is agile this is smart without the technology its secrets just taking care of me thank you very much that's a very quick introduction of the session and then will invite our colleagues to actually go through that in the meanwhile forgot to tell you about slider dot-com where you can ask questions using the hashtag war travel market LDN WTM LDN thank you now our next speaker is Mario Hardy chief executive of the Pacific Asia Travel Association and Mario is one of the very few people around in in the major organizations who are the same technology and embrace technology and think we have a feast thank you thank you good afternoon everyone thank you Demetrius don't need this thank you 've got my own technology with me if can get the assistance from the back to switch the screens on right well okay here we go you're very Demetria was talking about artificial intelligence or emotional intelligence AI robotics drones Exxon Amex so many other technologies that were inundated with every day we read about it we see it on TV we hear from friends from colleagues every single day we actually use technology we hear about it we talk about it but 'm actually here to talk to you about something a little bit different about what called exponential leadership thinking in two different futures long-distance future not about next year not about five years but about twenty thirty fifty hundred years from now and the decisions you make today can have implications in way into the future so how do we adapt how do we actually transform the way we think to be prepared for different futures that are arriving so fast the pace of change is phenomenal and we're all impacted by it so 'm going to share with you a very short video mean it caught it about half of it but from a program called the singularity University very famous gentleman by the name of Peter Diamandis who runs this with another German come by Ray Kurzweil and who's going to give you a bit of an overview of the tech that is coming up which is already here and we get the sound nope give it another 10 seconds otherwise we'll skip the video what goes wrong with technology it always we don't have any pets or children here disaster we go technology children and pets that's it a disaster ok won't take too much time will skip the video apologize for that but actually what Peter Diamandis and Ray Kurzweil are talking about and many other famous leaders in the technology industry actually sharing with you that the future is already here their science fiction movies we've dreamed about or we've seen where we're kids they're actually here this technology is no longer science fiction it's happening today autonomous cars they're here to stay drones they're coming they're already here in many places around the world and many other technologies that you've heard about earlier artificial intelligence and robotics and it will affect every one of you everyone's life will be changed because of this technology in the future you like it or not you may want to embrace it you may not want to embrace it but you will be affected by it either way some of this technology you've already been using artificial intelligence we've been talking about it quite a lot over the recent 1224 months but actually you've all been using AI for a number of time now do make a difference between conscious AI and a very simple AI we use today when you do Google search you use and forth some form of AI when you use mobile apps when you do your online banking when you do other activities on your mobile phones or other platforms you use some form of AI and it's here to stay they will change everything we do we live in a world which is uncertainty is actually what we wake up every morning at 3 o'clock when we receive a tweet from a White House in the US but also about many other news we get on a daily basis and affects all the changes we live not only with technologies but also the political world we live in so the message have for you today is that we need to wake change the way we think we are all being trained to think as local thinkers in a linear fashion include myself in this we've been taught that actually the future is an extension to the past as a business owner you're probably told by your boards you need to increase your revenues by X percent if you're lucky maybe you get 5% if you're not so lucky maybe your board will ask you for 10 20 or even more percent increases that's what we call in your thinking if you think exponentially where you want your business to be in 10 20 30 50 years from now what is the journey you're going to take to get to that destination what are the things you decisions you're going to make today that will make your business grow into the future and also more rewarding for yourself for your employees and for your community one of the biggest issues we fail to imagine a different future we're all surprised by innovation that comes in wake up in the morning a new world has been completely changed think of Airbnb fake a blockbuster for those of you who remember not so much around anymore Kodak and many other technologies which has been surpassed they fail to imagine a different future they fail to innovate they fail to actually look at what can we do today that will actually change the world in the future so think it's really important for all of us to change or break the permafrost of leadership 've been waking up for the last 12 months every morning thinking how will we positively impact the life of a billion people how what can do today what can our organization do every day they will positively impact the life of a billion people it may be true the use of technology it may be to the use of different other tools that are out there but we all play a part of it and yes may not change a life of being people in my lifetime but if can impact a few thousands a few hundred thousand and if we all work together and impact the life of people moving forward and think it's something we're all worth thinking about so thank you very much thank you Mario and it's especially when you're looking to Asia a lot of these technologies are already there and actually a lot of the impact that's happening is actually enabled by these technologies and that is nowhere more evident than China where because of the volume of people in China if this smartness is something that's practiced very prominently so Eileen if you can come up and join us Eileen is going to do the presentation for what drawer is doing drawer is on the forefront of smartness in in China they are supporting a whole range of different destinations and actually 'm not going to take your streets so it's all yours good afternoon ladies and gentlemen feel the great honour to be here first of our would thank you to Professor to me trope Hollis thank you for your invitation to take me in such a big exhibitions 'm very happy to have had this opportunity to share some small tourism applications in the China market 'm a for Hangzhou China which is a beautiful choice in cities and our company story technology it's devoted to provide to provide solution of the intelligent of the smart origins to destination management organizations which cover planning design and crowd rent surveys we have more than one thousand crimes in the world including British musings that love the lovers the state of the liabilities of Americans and other Sony sport will and 'm sure everybody is interesting the big Gators and they are applications so will show you some a little bit some cases in the China market don't prepare TPT's so will tell you some a little bit stories hope it won't be boring for you in the China market we will provide the big data assistance to tour in Sony sport if the tourists buy the ticket online they can use the QR code or the identical to pass the entrance so they don't need tickets and the insurance systems can correct all the information from the tourism income including age and the genders and custom customer orange earns the rotator of the visa union pain are limpid our cisterns can analyse the tourism behaviour and they are spending Hobbit for example we built a big state a big data systems for the hunter tourism views and they use big data to analyse the tourism behaviour in the hands of cities and we found the Korea is the big stock group of the tourists in the Hangzhou and the Dutch is half the high level of the consumer levels so this is interesting things we found the touch the sprays the torture would like to go is the Nanshan road which is the Abbas during the Hong and then the next year hunter tourism bureaus launched more advertisement in the Northland so this is a good examples to explain how big data improved the hands of government behaviour in the near future believe or in IR s less imaginations we don't need to checking in in dust reception at the hotels when we when we use the computer or iPhone cooking the hotel in the poke intercom or decoders the cameras will catch your photos and if your photos matches our ID card you can catch the room call are you ok the room number directories where you go when you arrive the hotel you can go to the room and the room doors will open for you through the phase recognitions so and as all the checking in precise can completed in the rooms we can get better travel experience turning to the AI application the museum voice seasons and the voice organizations can be extreme using not can be using the ideal house you can choose your favourite voice to explain the music knowledge to you for example you can choose the Adele's or the Taurus Swift's to explain the museum to you and the children's maybe choose the Mickey Mouse voice and it'll will be interesting of course it might be related to the copyrights or the private but think it will fix in the futures so this is all we have thrown in the China market in the future we will do more IR for the VR applications in the Museum of the scenic sport and the way will get better experiencing the tourist destination thank you very much thank you thank you and my understanding is that you are building for the British Museum the guiding system and one of the next developments is augmented reality in the British Museum as well yeah thank you so much Faye's you are doing for your doing systems that support muscle tourism to travel around would you like to say it with us what are you doing yeah thank you so much thank you hello everyone can have to kick off the clicker thank you so much all right so today 'm going to be talking a little bit about smart tourism and basically how we can actually use big data technology to improve not just a livelihood of the whole entire travel experience but also for the company side to generate a lot more revenue and think for a lot of the companies a lot of the destination money is what counts so this is my Twitter if you have any question feel free if you have photos please tweet me okay so this is if you have a look at this picture what is fascinating about this is that it's like it showcase 60,000 different routes that happens every single day so a lot of the people 'm not sure how many of you here are not from London but came from Malaysia and was on one of this route so this is very fascinating because it shows that a lot of the people are constantly travelling which we travel a lot and in travel has moved from the traditional travel of we take what is given to we want and a personalized travel experience and that's for a lot of people is very important so for a destination and for a lot of the travel sites or travel provider all of the questions that we can ask ourselves is what influences people what influences people's choice of destination where do people travel you want to understand why people go to certain places and no other places so what combination of insight are most relevant in driving growth within specific market segments which will then enables you so with data for a lot of the destination they can use the data to understand the choices of people why they make certain choices and from then on make a better plan planning to ensure that the whole travel experiences is much more better so what we do is actually work a lot with a lot of hotels a lot of destination and a lot of travel sites primarily in the area of Muslim travels so this is a typical search pattern for Singapore so if any of you are from Singapore been to Singapore typically for a lot of the Muslim travellers these are the areas that they're searching for areas such as the Marina Bay Sands and in certain area but what is fascinating is that with data itself again when you match it with the booking data you'll be able to see that the booking pattern or what people are looking for in in in Singapore is a lot different to what people are searching for so this kind of data is very interesting and what nation can use is to understand why people choose certain area within a specific city and not the others and from then on make a better planning and improve the whole either infrastructure the whole hotel distribution and pricing in etc. by 2020 and this is a this is a data by Gartner so they show what they found out actually is that 85% of relationship with an increasing Enterprise without interacting with human and a lot of travel sites are actually embracing that within the travel industry we've seen a lot of the travel companies Kolm for example they've launched a chat bot whereby you can actually interact with the chat bot without any human to book your flight ticket and it is very interesting because not only are the chat bots are there to answer your question but think what is fascinating is that it collects the data from the chat pod itself you'll be able to understand KLM for example or kayak they'll be able to understand what people are searching for what are the travel data people are interested in and provide a packages or solution to this specific needs so within data itself they'll be able to actually create a better product so how can the question that 'm going to pose to you is basically how can destination use data not only to predict but also to better plan and to create an entirely new product new segmentation or an entirely new product itself thank you thank you very much face it it's very dressing when you start looking to specialist part of the market and how you serve that market and how do you engage and how do you understand in real time what's happening and how you optimize performance at the same time my good friend Richard Lewis kept him for the end and he just gave me the notes of his new affiliation as the chief executive officer of northern principal development house powerhouse development 'm going to learn it it's a new job okay you'll learn or you'll be shot yeah okay which has got a new business model which 'll ask Richard actually to explain it better than and then do Richard they've got the floor thank you very much good afternoon everyone where did the flicka go so firstly northern powerhouse developments very interesting business model 've only been with the company since July but what we do is we buy hotels in two destinations in the UK along the coast and actually manor houses up and down the country with spectacular views so what we do is we buy the property we exchange terms with the vendor and then we have a completion date which is about twelve months from our exchange and what we do is we sell bedrooms in that hotel to investors all over the world and then we lease the bedroom back from them and operate the hotel ourselves and they actually become our landlord and we are paying them a rent to take that room from them and operate it we maintain a hundred percent control of that room we can buy it back from the investor at any point they can sell it back to us and force us to supply it back from them after 10 years that's the model it's very simple we have ten hotels that we operate we've got a further four that we bought and we'll be operating them within eighteen months so in five minutes what am going to focus on the answer is artificial intelligence artificial general intelligence and machine learning but 'm going to focus for the travel industry in marketing and hopefully give you a few tips which may be of interest to you to see what you can do for your own businesses while 'm doing that please remember that business is about three things one trust do you trust the people that you're buying from that you're doing business with the second is about relationships and can you really have a true relationship with the machine some people would argue yes but actually at some point you have to interact and it is about relationships and the third one which will probably be the most important and difficult for AI to match human beings is emotion it's passion can a really match the emotion that we can deliver as human beings and do they say see things exactly the same so put it to you that you do not see things the same so 'm going to show you a slide now so it's a bit of fun in the afternoon all want you to do is count the number of letter F's that you see on this slide so if you're not English the letter F think everyone know it's the letter F all you're doing is counting the number of letter FS on the next slide are you ready okay how many people saw none that's a good start one two anymore for two don't be shy you've got to put your hand up at some point three four five six okay those put who say six please stand up okay have a look around the room and see how many people said six so these people saw something you didn't see right how is it possible all you're doing is counting the letter F but we all see something different so let me show you again for those of you who did not count six seeing if you can now count six knowing that there are six the reason why you can't see six if you still can't see is because you're not counting the letter F of the word of and the reason why psychologically you don't count that letter F is because you're spelling the word ovie you're not spelling it Oh F so you don't see it so we've all seen something different but you're all looking at the same thing and that is why in business we will always have an opportunity to add value to artificial general intelligence so to live one's own life as an individual and to enjoy personalized experiences is the new luxury and there are so many companies in our industry trying to do that but isn't that almost like saying we know who you are so you're no longer an individual we know everything about you so we're going to tell you what you want before you even know it what sort of individual life of freedom are you living at that point so can you actually get individuality through big data as individuals we see the world differently we've just proven that right can promise if you're in the hotel business you will have one member of staff walking over a piece of paper and the next member of staff picking it up because the first person doesn't see it or doesn't care and the essence surely the essential element is choice if want to go to a hotel because 'm on business and want to see nobody and want to get to my bedroom as fast as can and want to use my telephone my mobile phone to check-in to get into the lift to get into my room allow me to do it but if want to talk to somebody because 'm on holiday and want to learn about the environment give me that choice don't force your will on my experience so it's about personal touch versus Big Brother service versus intrusion people actually getting into your life learning more about you than you know yourself it's about experience versus privacy we all want to remain private but can we truly remain private when Google are doing what Google are doing and last night at an for travel dinner there were 40 people from this industry in the technology world and the question was is Google a force for good in travel and tourism won't tell you what we felt but who thinks that Google is a force for good in travel and tourism put your hands up okay who thinks that Google is evil within our industry or maybe who evils too harsh a word let's say not a force for good okay everybody else must have very sore bottoms because you're all sitting on the fence yesterday out of 40 people 36 said that Google was a force for good only four people said it was not good for our industry we also need to look after personal data and if you are from Europe you'll know that on the 25th of May next year there are going to be new regulations coming in to all European countries including the UK even if we've come out of the EU by then we have to be extremely careful what we do with people's data so the better you know your customer the better you can adapt your offering that is a fact but information needs to be used in creative and targeted ways it's about interpretation it's not data access we've got data overload how good are you at the analytics it's about finding patterns AI is all about finding patterns that's why machines are so good at it and it's about supporting your own strategic direction not being dictated by the machine there is a need for efficiency and transparency so what do we need we need to adapt an integrated approach just as Demetrius was saying it's about systems and systems integration we need to utilize the machine learning for repetitive tasks why do we need to do that machines are far better at doing repetitive tasks and we will ever be and we need to reduce the increasing marketing performance gap so here were my four tips if you haven't started yet to use AI machine learning one developed the right team you have to develop the right team internally and then combine it with your out sourced resource you need to build your analytical skills find the very best people who understand the data that's in front of them because without those people you really have nothing you've got lots and lots of data but you make no sense of it whatsoever you have to integrate all your systems and create a flexible strategy because again as Mario was saying today is not going to be the same as tomorrow if you have some rigid approach like blockbuster like Kodak like Thomas Cook in the old days you will not survive you have to have a flexible approach in business so smart tourism want to give you an example northern powerhouse development of hotels and what three words who's heard of what three words ok we're getting better we've got a few more people ok will show you a little video clip in a minute what three words it's very simple then northern powerhouse hotels will be using watery words to help old guests to arrive safely to an accurate point for the entrance of the hotel so what three words has divided the world surface into 57 trillion three meter by three meter squares and every square on planet Earth has a very simple and easy to communicate three word address so where you're sitting right there you have a three word address which is completely different to the three word address that dr. Roger Carter has in the audience at the back the entrance to a car park has a three word address and if you wanted to join me or the beach at Jumeirah Beach for a barbecue on Friday could give you the three word address right now for that piece of sand where you would find me on Friday every single thing on planet Earth so if you're in the travel business you should be looking after your guests by giving them precise points that they can travel to not postal codes which are not accurate so 'd like to show you a little video as to what three words can do for your business could you play the video please that really is smart tourism thank you thank you very much 'm not so if anybody has actually put questions on slide oh we've got about ten minutes to take some questions have we got slide no questions we don't have any slides of questions anybody who has got any questions anybody who has got any questions what would you like to stop the session here and then have individual discussions later on yeah okay let's do that thank you very much for coming along ah smart tourism is really about going to the future and you've seen different examples from cow artificial intelligence system to graphical systems of big data or huge data actually in China are going to be used to enable better to come along and talk to us we'll be here for another ten minutes thank you very much never good to go to market in this video we are going to take you through big data in the hospitality industry big data is of great use in many sectors starting from choosing the movie we would like to watch to take critical business decisions big data is the core of all operations but who might have imagined that the technology would be a part of our journey when we stay at hotels or go on exploring places yes big data is stealing the hospitality industry by associating with customers behaviour and interactions hotels and other facilities functioning under the hospitality industry fence are getting a grip with the concept of big data to increase its performance and revenue hotels leverage big data to tailor the customized experience and optimally price and manage their consumers big data content such as the information on occupancy rates current bookings key performance metrics school holidays local events etc. contributes to better hotel performance which eventually increases its revenue big data provides a better understanding of guests that helps in making personalized advertisements and promotions besides it also aids restaurants to address issues on the menu like negligence of certain dishes by performing analysis the hotel executive can get an idea of why the dish is not performing well big data is everywhere but those who make good use of it is the real genius the hospitality industry is now stepping into the adventure of using big data to personalize and enhance customer experience with the help of big data analytics they provide sophisticated services even before the consumers think about them want to talk about Big Data today because at the graph of institute for tourism we are increasingly using big data sources for analysis now normally we rely on asking people what they do or business is how they perform but now we look at things like transport data we can trust see the chilling coming in and social media use data so data that's available at very large volumes and in real time so far with a high velocity and we're working with the big data lab on a number of projects one is on the great barrier reef where we analyse tourism Twitter data to see whether what people say about the reef can be used for environmental monitoring because we're concerned about the condition of the reef and it would be a very cost-effective way of finding out things are going well or if there's issues and if we can use the Twitter data another project is here on the Gold Coast where we want to find out how satisfied to us are and based on how they tweet and what they tweet about so we're working with the council loading all sorts of data sources to link them up with the Twitter data so quite exciting stuff and will take you soon to the big data left to have a look at the technology behind the scene data analytics is a powerful tool particularly when we have a huge amount of the art available and social media is one form of this data there is an open data and so all if properly analyse this data can provide the valuable information about the sentiment about the event object or even a person problem is huge amount of data holstered significant challenge and requires the new methods for the processing computing and also for storing it also requires the new method for analysis because existing methods simply does not work and they are not applicable on this big data and how a group is working on it real-time analytics of social media on our other platform provides indication about tourism sentiment as you can see on this specific application for them information platform big data is something generated by the computerized infrastructure and facilities we have such a large volume of data because they have been heavily used to monitor the people behaviour people attitudes and people's image towards tourism destination specifically in our field we are posting videos on Instagram we are tweeting every single day and this is a very typical data source for big data for example from a twitter from the Instagram we can understand the trend of consumers that can be used to see you know what's people's preference to what trouble and there's the ending specific destination is going to be really attractive appealing to different kinds of customers Big Data and Analytics more and more tourism hospital business are going to focus on big data analytics you can use it for your daily operation daily decision making think it's going to be a very important skill set for tourism hospitality students they acknowledge the value of big data and they know how to analyse it and they know how to convert the data to the business insights that are very beneficial to their business we can monitor different social media posts like you know people sometimes they are positive and sometimes they are negative and we can figure out in which specific field they are a little bit sceptical Conclusion we are being teaching them how to collect the data how to analyse data with some user-friendly tools like a hospitality finance class like the revenue management class this class are incorporating very cutting-edge data tools and data source to make sure that students get exposed to this kind of very important very innovative things that is currently happening in the industry and make their ready as the next generation of industry leader if you really have this passion for data analytics or big data analytics if you think you're the right person to conduct this kind of task in your future career please feel free to contact us and you will really enjoy your experience at school of sport tourism hospitality management at temple university today's travellers now turn to dozens of sites search engines and social media to plan their journey with more travel options and appealing destinations tourism and emerging economies is projected to grow two times faster than in developed economies facing greater competition tourism bureaus need to identify and attract more valuable visitor segments deep traveller insights can provide an edge but big data can be overwhelming and difficult to analyse and standard surveys and reports are often based on small sample sizes and quickly become outdated introducing MasterCard tourism insights we transform vast amounts of anonymized aggregated data on what travellers search for book spend and say into valuable insights giving demos a 360 degree view of the traveller journey insights into each stage of the traveller journey can help tourism bureaus identify more valuable visitor segments and make smarter marketing investments here's an example the tourism agency of a popular global destination wanted to draw more visitors for holiday shopping we analysed millions of social media mentions to gauge consumer sentiment and interest in the city versus its competitors the tourism agency was surprised to learn that nearby consumers were not the most interested in shopping long range travellers were the best target markets guided by these consumer insights the city launched a campaign that drew over 70 million hits during the holiday season with MasterCard tourism insights you too can discover actionable insights to inform your marketing investments attract more valuable visitors segments more often big data and analytics create significant opportunities for businesses to harness the wealth of data to support their activities and to gain competitive advantage in tourism and hospitality we have seen effective use of big data for example in revenue management in market research and insights in customer experience and in reputation management and in more recent years we've also seen a rapid shift to our more forward-looking and even automated data-driven organizations such as international hotel chains now relying on robotics to deliver some of their services all these emerging technologies are collecting storing and using traveller information however these technological developments have significant implications for personal data privacy and for data governance frameworks that tourism and hospitality organizations need to develop and implement to ensure competitive and ethical business practices our article highlights that conversations regarding data privacy must be grounded in ethics and trust and should shift from organizations just asking are we compliant toward are we doing the right thing this is why data governance frameworks developed by tourism and hospitality organizations need to expand from merely compliance-based frameworks to inclusion of privacy and ethics solutions for an equitable and ethical exchange of data and information so organizations must ensure that insights into the behaviour of their consumers do not come at the cost of violation of their privacy and instead place equal weight on efforts to achieve both objectives we'll talk about how to leverage big data for tourism recovery it is the first joint knowledge event that the ad is organizing together with the un world tourism organization we're very excited about this new partnership and we are looking forward to a strong effective collaboration ahead let me quickly turn to the topic of the today's webinar we have started to think about the big data and how to utilize the big data for the tourism industry already before the coving 19 pandemic we realized while the private sector has moved fast in collecting and utilizing big data the public sector has been rather slow in taking advantage of big data for policy making big data has a huge potential to improve tourism policy and management especially as the pandemic has hit the tourism industry so hard and many uncertainties exist we need to be quick on our big data which is often available with the short time lag very high frequency can make an important contribution to successful recovery of the tourism industry after COVID over the past months we have collaborated with a number of experts including those from unto to better understand the potential of big data and how to use it best for our opportunities today we will present the preliminary findings of a joint ad unto report on big data and tourism this report will show how the public and private sector can create a win-win scenarios and use big data to maximize its full potential it is it will also show how to leverage big data for the recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic let me stop here and introduce our very distinguished guest Mr Manuel butler executive director of the un world tourism organization Mr butler is the executive director of unto since June 2018 prior to joining the unto he was the CEO of tourespania twice between 2012 and 2013 and 2016 and 2018 he was also the president of the European travel committee in 2013. he has been working in the management position in the public and private sector in the western Europe as well as north and Latin America Mr butler the floor is yours thank you very much see john park director of the red fashion development bank good afternoon to everyone good morning to a couple of us they are here in Europe it is a pleasure working alongside the think is more than me that is a must one of the clear lessons to be learned from the pandemic is the importance of resilience planning and obviously need to work on the basis of network logic working jointly both institutions adv. and unto is an excellent example this webinar shows the importance of working together and using big data we are living in an unprecedented change in paradigm we know becoming four years in central to build altogether the future of the tourism is leaving his childhood behind and transitioning into adulthood means taking responsibilities and at the same time are more complex there is a structure is more and more complex specifically regarding the value chains and in business operations more complexity means a higher need of evidence-based decisions on better understanding the potential of big data companies are already on the front line of issues such as already having exploiting the increasing amount of big data the public sector needs also to use the generated bid data by the tourism industry to better manage a more and more sustainable and inclusive tourism the unto recommendations for actions for action and guidelines to restart tourism calling for urgent and strong support to help the global team sector not only recover from the unprecedented challenge of the Quebec 19 but to grow back better in these recommendations big data plays a key role such investing in data and in market intelligence systems to monitor behaviour anticipate trends and adjust product design and marketing strategies evidence-based decisions and strategies are key particularly the moments of crisis investing in data analysis and partnerships allow for close short-term monitoring of tourism development and impact we have to generate data support setting up and growing up our network of national and local sustainable trends observatories the so-called insta network to measure all dimensions of tourism we're in partnership with relevant stakeholders and we share this information with the sector building back better requires there is to embrace a holistic vision of sustainability build new and better measurements and promote changes in policy governance financing private behaviour and business models and in this context big data is one of the pillars for going ahead hope this webinar helps in the sense to build back a better tourist for the well-being of tourists and local population alive alike thank you very much again to the ash and the block bank giving us this opportunity to working together thank you very much to all and wish a very a successful webinar thank you thank you Mr butler let me now introduce our presenters today uh first presentation will be delivered by Mr Trevor welt man whose partner clickable impact consulting group his presentation will be about big data for better tourism policy and management Trevor is the immediately passed chief operating officer of the pacific Asia travel association called pata where he used to oversee the day-to-day operations of the association across its three offices in Bangkok Beijing and London and also spearheaded the creation of the pata crisis resource centre Trevor has over 10 years of experience in Asia covering china Vietnam and Thailand at present Trevor is a partner at clickable impact consulting group an interdisciplinary consultancy focused on the sustainable development goals following Trevor’s presentation our consultant Juan he chow will make a presentation on revitalizing the tourism industry through big data is currently she is currently the senior economics research associate of the economic research and the regional cooperation department she's conducting economic research on tourism so Trevor you have 20 minutes and then one year will pro provide another 10 minute presentation so the floor is yours Trevor thank you very much dry park did do a run through this morning it was 20 minutes and 10 seconds so if i'm a touch over 20 minutes please uh please excuse me it will be done quickly so hello everybody thank you for having me i'm going to go ahead and share my screen but i'm admittedly not uh a power teams user i'm more of a zoom guy so i'm going to just try to get this set up and make sure it will work and get my notes in a line and then we will go from there so let me get it up and looking okay can somebody confirm can you see my screen yes you can okay thank you Matthias okay good afternoon and good morning uh ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for having me here big thank you to dry park and Mr butler for the warm introductions and for also including pot in this great initiative so my name is Trevor welt man and today i'm here to talk about big data for better tourism policy management and the sustainable recovery from covid19 as mentioned by dry park just want to be clear at the beginning that this is a preliminary finding so today's presentation is based on a report that ad had and unto had commissioned from pata that pata had actually consulted on so these are the preliminary findings that have not received comment yet from ad and until though we're quite confident in in what we're presenting with that in mind uh it's a lot of information to pack into 20 minutes the report itself is over 90 pages so i'm actually going to try to give a high level understanding of what is the true role of big data and digitalization in the future of tourism and then at the end i'm going to give some practical context for how big data is helping us so the first part i'm just going to quickly touch on the context and impact of covet 19 on the industry for the second part i'm going to talk about this idea of how big data is going to help us create these smart destinations of the future and for the final part as shared i'm going to give some insights into the role of big data in covet 19 recovery and the sustainable future of tourism so before get into the presentation though do want to ask what is our goal why are we even talking about tourism or why are we even talking about big data and tourism think it's important to say at the beginning that what our goal is not or what our goal is not only our goal for big data is not only for marketing and product development it's not only to better leverage our online platforms and digitalization and it's also not only for COVID 19 recovery although it is an urgent issue that we need to pay attention to as i'm sure many of you saw this political cartoon make its rounds on Facebook or on social media at the beginning part of the year we have to keep in mind that the crisis facing the tourism industry is not simply about the short-term needs to revive the industry from covet 19. we need to use COVID 19 as the springboard to help us combat climate change you know just as an example if some of the sea level reports that ’ve seen come true over the next few years those of us based in Bangkok manila Jakarta our livelihoods are at risk say nothing of the tourism ministries the significant tourism industries that these destinations house so we need to make sure that when we talk about big data and tourism we also have that long-term vision about tourism-driven sustainable infrastructure that is how do we turn tourism into a foremost driver of the sustainability resilience and inclusiveness agendas and we do that by building these smart destinations and i'm going to touch on this in much more detail as the presentation goes forward so before we even get too deep into big data there's plenty that we have to do in order to help the industry come back and respond to the perils of covid19 and in fact we've pulled just a couple sentences from our overall policy recommendations at the end of the report we've written uh it's important to say that you know we need the holistic accounting we need to build up the local capacity of our destination managers we need new blended finance for uh sustainable infrastructure and for the sums but we also need to know how to do it and that's what i'm going to talk about now is how can big data help us build those smart destinations and then how is big data going to help us achieve everything on this list not only for the recovery from covet 19 but to the sustainable development of the industry to perpetuity so this is going to bring me to the second part of my presentation today which is tourism big data and creating smart destinations so before we can talk about where we want to go to the smart destinations we have to better understand where we're coming from and that's the traditional tourism statistics and we also have to give credit where credit is due this list of numbers basically contained on this table are responsible for helping drive the industry forward over the last 50 years to becoming the global economic juggernaut that it is this is a list of specific airline data hotel data arrivals data demographic based market research economic impact analysis as well as some transportation data and again by using these as the north star metrics for the industry we see that 10.3 percent of global gap and the 330 million jobs around the world supported that being said our traditional tourism statistics have limitations these are considered small data in most destinations as they're reliant mostly on the census and survey in terms of methodology for collection believe it or not in most destinations particularly in our region this is still a heavily analogy process it's not yet digitized meaning that these are time and resource intensive and beyond the time and resource intensively they're not available on demand there's a significant lag between the collection time the processing time and then ultimately the publication time to market so to cover some of those limitations of the traditional tourism statistics the industry has started to work with what we're going to call traditional tourism big data providers now this is actually a catch-all term for many things but being honest when people talk about traditional tourism big data they're really just referring to the online travel platforms these can come in in a few different categories ’ve tried to break them out here but essentially online travel refers the platforms we use when we book our holidays our vacation rentals our flights ride hailing etc. and just to give an overview i'm sure most people on call use at least one of these brands when booking their travel if not for research than the actual booking this is an incomplete list of about 20 20 providers that are the prominent providers globally but already this list represents over a hundred billion dollars of revenue per year so that starts to give us an understanding of the true size and scope of online travel furthermore over fifty percent of bookings around the world are now taking place online which again given the numbers of the industry starts to show the true size of this data so what are the benefits that we receive when we work with traditional tourism big data there's the billions of data points this can actually help us monitor demand in bookings in real time it gives us these deep cross-border and cross-sector consumer insights that our small data cannot provide as Mr butler shared at the beginning we start to get that enhanced marketing breach and targeting the great product development from those feedback loops of the enhanced behaviour analysis of our target consumers and then importantly to dispersal campaigns which is a great a great tool in the toolkit of destination managers to be able to leverage these platforms and their marketing capability to entice tourists to go to new and different destinations instead of constantly concentrating in a limited number of places now i'm going to say this with a smile because actually this slide represents about a quarter of the report that we wrote and could go could we could probably teach a semester in a university on this slide alone about the limitations and challenges of traditional tourism big data so i'm not going to go into too much of detail on this because even though it's a focus of the report it's not the focus of the presentation today suffice it to say that traditional tourism big data has its opportunities but we have challenges some of them are technical in terms of the selectivity bias the continuity the debt invisibles some of them are based on the skills of our destination managers or the resources in terms of cost available to our destinations but again put this to show that there are limitations and challenges to using it but it's not a focus instead this is actually the focus of today's presentation and it's this that actually both the traditional tourism statistics and tourism big data have a primary limitation and it's this they have an implicit growth agenda and that growth agenda is implicitly economic it looks towards the economic success of the industry without wholly accounting for the environmental and social uh issues in the industry so again with the second point they do not account for the invisible burden of tourism which are these tourism externalities and so in short if our industry wants to become sustainable it will never become a driver of sustainability if these metrics continue to be the only north star metrics we use in destination planning so where did get this idea for invisible burden it actually comes from this great report that was published in 2019 from pepperwood international Cornell university and the travel foundation and ’ve condensed the report but essentially the focus are these unaccounted for externalities of tourism basically the unmeasured externality of tourists create hidden burdens on destinations environments societies and economies now these externalities are ultimately borne by the local communities where tourists operate and therefore call to question the unquestioned belief in tourism's net benefits ’ve provided here a screenshot from the report so we can start to get a sense for what are some of those unaccounted for externalities emissions renewable energy costs renewable water sources and then a big oversight here which are the social cultural restoration and maintenance of a destination as a result of this invisible burden that same report gives us two solutions to look for to build back more sustainably it says first new holistic accounting systems that capture the full range of costs stemming from the growth of tourism are needed these will by the by taking into account the climate the habitat and the social costs of destinations hosting travellers and tourists but the key thing powering the holistic accounting are new data and technology sources that are measuring resource consumption to better protect the local environment and cultural heritage to benefit those communities as a result then what we've talked to and we focused on mostly to date as an industry has been these traditional tourism statistics and the traditional tourism big data whereas what we're hearing in the invisible burden and other reports too of course is to start shifting the focus over to management this means supplementing our tours our traditional tourism statistics and traditional tourism big data with smart cities big data to build those holistic accounting mechanisms or enhance metrics for sustainable outcomes to give us those smart destinations now what do mean by smart cities big data these are the large networks of sensors used to monitor and track various municipal services typically using IOT or internet of things devices it could be mundane like car parking or noise monitoring or more profound in this instance to things like water usage traffic surveillance electricity use and air pollution i'm going to kind of bulk uh telecom data under smart cities big data here because it's IOT driven which our colleague is going to go into more detail with the next presentation about but suffice to say that there are big benefits to using these automated sources of big data first they're automated or they're designed to collect the data they're highly accurate as they show real usage in real time from what users are actually doing and these are practical data and insights actually tied to the management of a destination now what we've done at pod is we we've developed these are supposed to be green these two oops we've developed a uh a schematic here that says if a destination was actually going to be smart what would those data flows look like and how would those impact the investment flows so as you'll see here on the schematic we have these one-way and also two-way data flows between our infrastructure and our private and our public sector which are ultimately leading to enhanced investment decisions in sustainable tourism technology and infrastructure my apologies as these two arrows here are supposed to be green showing that the enhanced data flows are actually giving the enhanced infrastructure investments from the public sector and the private sector now the result of this then starts to answer that question posed at the beginning of my presentation today which are what are those fundamental goals of tourism big data first we begin to understand truly the value and the cost on a per tourist basis and a destination or that invisible burden and second by understanding that true value and that true cost we get to make enhanced tourism-driven sustainable infrastructure investments that are more sustainable as well as better target our capacity development decisions and interventions for our destination managers and our trade okay so uh let me go to the next slide understand that that was very condensed and also quite theoretical but again want to make sure that we're seeing it for what it is it's not only the online platforms but the management of tourism is also going to be dependent on these new data streams from the smart cities data and IOT data with that in mind though also want to be practical want to show everybody now in this third part how big data is actually being used for covid19 recovery which believe is also a focus of Juana’s presentation next so the first is want to share the emerging strategy that we're seeing across destinations around the world related to traditional tourism big data being used for promoting domestic tourism we're seeing it in Macau we're seeing it in Singapore we're seeing it in Thailand where the destinations are partnering with these online platforms and then also providing deals and vouchers for redemption on those platforms to get their domestic populations out and actually engaging with their tours and businesses at this time of prolonged border closures very interestingly as well we're seeing a higher adoption of the uh the uh destinations using the payment options for these platforms which is very interesting meaning that they're actually supplying the vouchers to be redeemed on a on a weave chat or excuse me on a we pay or on a grad pay for them the businesses who maybe were not on the online platforms before in order to capture this domestic market it's forcing their own digitalization now they have to sign up to these platforms to receive those payments and think Ricky’s uh Ricky hoy from Macau is going to go into more details in the panel discussion about this the next way that we're seeing big data assist with uh coveted recovery is actually helping with opening of borders and creating regional harmony you know pre-coveted 19 the industry was already making significant advances with the seamless travel agenda this is the use of technology notably biometrics and the use of a digital identity to enable a seamless and secure end-to-end travel traveller journey now early on in the crisis we heard a lot about we need health passports we need digital passports etc. since that early part of the crisis in the first part of this year this brand common pass this organization is sort of emerged as the leader or the winning health passport globally this is a project that's a collaboration between an NGO called the commons project backed by the Rockefeller foundation and the world economic forum essentially it's using block chain and import and interoperable technology to securely unite airports airlines health authorities immigration and travellers i'm just going to show you quickly how this works in essence in in destination or point of origin a traveller will get their lab test for coved or their vaccination certification that lab result using block chain will be sent securely to an app on their phone they will carry that with them by way of a QR code to the different checkpoints as they travel in October 2020 successful pilots already took place between the up and the us and Hong Kong and Singapore and in November importantly common pass was endorsed by the airport's consul international and the world's three major airline alliances sky team one world and star alliance so this is already up and running and we're going to continue to see more of this finally at the last part of my presentation today want to share two models that have emerged from different sources about reimagining the future management of the travel and tourism industry not only through covid19 but also beyond the first model want to share is from McKinney and this is their establishment of their idea of a tourism nerve centre now they've given four points that they believe all destinations should be paying attention to as they try to build back through the pandemic and into the future two of these their nerve centre and then this last point enabling a digital analytics transformation are heavily focused on big data this is the schematic from their article and ’ve highlighted this part here that they call industry observatory but if you read it and you pay attention to how they build this this argument through their report they're just talking tours and big data essentially the destination needs to become the central spoke of data and analysis particularly big data to be able to get that information in centralize it analyse it kick it out to the trade so the trade can make better decisions at this time but also for their own policy development and governance to be able to make those better and enhanced decisions another model that's emerged is from the same author of the invisible burden report about earlier in my presentation which is what she has called a marshal plan for tourism can it be built like McKinney she's also advocating for a rethinking of how the destinations themselves are actually structured in terms of management and is proffering a four-part sustainable tourism investment hub it proctors an some fund a sustainable infrastructure fund the increased capacity building and technical assistance but really at the heart of it and her argument is the centre for destination information and technology this is that core hub that's building towards that holistic accounting those enhanced metrics for sustainable outcomes but in the short term in the covet period that data hub will be providing the information to get our sustainable infrastructure our some recovery and our capacity building fully off the ground so have 15 seconds left i'm going to move to my conclusion today uh as shared at the beginning look we can talk about this forever but really our goal is not only tourism big data from marketing and product development better leveraging of online platforms and digitalization and it cannot only be about covet 19 recovery we need to start thinking not only about the marketing side we need to springboard from that to the management side to reach our fundamental goals of tourism big data or the role that tourism big data can be in helping us build these smart destinations so we finally can start to understand the value and cost per tourist that invisible burden of tourism to ultimately give us the enhanced tourism-driven infrastructure investment and capacity development decisions remember this is a long-term crisis if we can accomplish this in and through covet 19 then we truly stand a chance to not only revive our industry but to turn tourism into a foremost driver of the sustainability resilience and inclusiveness agendas so with that thank you all for your time today took 20 minutes and 50 seconds not 10 seconds my apologies but you can email me anytime at this address if you have further questions and ’ve also put a QR code for my for my LinkedIn so thank you all very much for your time today over to you Matthias and dry park thank you Trevor without further any uh do um can turn to one he to make the presentation correct uh hello can you hear me yes we can hear you all right let me show my presentation first alright so uh good morning good afternoon wherever you are in the world am janitor from the economic research and regional cooperation department of ad and am pleased to present to you today on how we could use big data to understand tourism sector by ex-examining the case of republic of Korea would like to say that this presentation is a joint effort between ad and Korea telecom or kit in short so first on behalf of our colleagues from kit let me introduce kit’s tourist analysis method and tourism analysis solution we know that reliable and timely performance analysis is essential for the tourism industry to develop further as a result kit has been very much focused on using mobile data to analyse tourism so please let me present to you the results of what kit has accomplished so far so what is the logic behind identifying tourists using mobile data kit uses the let signal data for tourist analysis most telos use the car or the call detail record data to measure the floating population however car data is only generated when a customer uses a call or sends a message so data is generated very irregularly and there is a large gap between data points on the other hand let signal data is generated very regularly every five minutes on an average even when a mobile phone is not being used and for this reason let data is more appropriate for accurate analysis of tourism patterns in fact it is able to generate seven thousand percent more data than car then how do we know who is a tourist and how does kit identify tourists so Katie defines a signal captured around the base station at a certain time as an entire population then by analysing the pattern of the users stay in the area kit categorizes it as a resident or non-resident when signals are regularly captured at the certain time zone kit defines them as residents on the other hand the non-resident population is examined further in order to filter out who are the tourists by analysing tourist patterns the tourist population is estimated among the tourist population kit further categorizes it as domestic or foreign tourists as for domestic tourists they can be estimated and segmented into resident and run non-resident from the entire population captured in base stations by applying statistical behaviour of tourists the criteria for defining a domestic tourist is the number of visit the visit to the tourist sites this criteria was established after analysing actual data short-term visit foreigners can be identified from kit’s roaming data the criteria for defining foreign tourists is the length of tourist visits and according to roaming data foreign tourists visiting Korea are expected to stay a maximum of 15 days so we use 15 days as a criteria to identify tourists in general one's carrier's data does not cover the entire population therefore kit applies statistical techniques to calculate the overall number of tourists and Katie attempts to build the representative population out of the sample collected in this case of domestic tourists it is calculated by considering the market share of telos in the case of four estimated the statistics of entry and departure required by countries in terms of accuracy through the verification processes domestic and foreign tourist data estimations result 95 and 75 respectively next will introduce the tourism analysis solution kit has created so the travel intelligence platform or the trip is a platform that provides tourism statistics and tourism analysis using mobile and credit card data tourism statistics include detailed analysis of tourist visits tourist characteristics and length of visit by tourist site and festival period tourism analysis provide information by comparing the competitiveness of tourist sites in the five areas see eat buy stay and play and last but not the least tourism consulting supports local governments to address top challenges through reliable tourism statistics and analysis for the following slides will briefly introduce the main features of chair so this is the main page of trip so when you enter the urn in your browser this is what you'll be seeing at the moment unfortunately the website is only supported in the Korean language most data in the platform are updated on a weekly basis here you may choose to look at data on a weekly or a monthly basis here let's examine the trends for the week of November 30 to December 6. when you select an area of interest you will be able to identify overall status of tourists so today let's check on one of the districts in the Seoul metropolitan city so here click Seoul city then select jungle district it's one of the districts in the city on the right side of the map uh we'd be able to see the week on week changes in the number of visitors year and year changes and the breakdown on the number of visitors for the week that we're examining and we can also see the rankings under different categories let's check the tourist spot ranking so in the district of jungle myeongdong emerged as the number one tourist spot so think for those who have visited Seoul i'm sure you might have gone to this area at least once during your trip so this is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Seoul especially for foreign visitors for shopping or for food and when click this location you'll be able to see a detailed analysis result the size and characteristics of tourists can be identified by specific tourist sites so here we see that people in their 20s like to visit myeongdong the most between 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. most people come from another district of Seoul called then majority of the people remain in the same district jungle district after visiting myeongdong here you can also see the inflow and outflow into the certain area to identify movement patterns so in this case we are studying in terms of domestic tourists we can identify their gender age and place of residence on the other hand for foreign visitors we can identify their nationality so in this case jury two weeks ago 35.16 of the foreign visitors were from china but then again these are data from the week of November 30 to December 6 wherein the absolute number of tourists are very low at 3 000 visitors only aside from seeing data in the tabular form trip also supports the so we could check travel patterns of tourists using the map here can choose the point of interest and period then click to see inflow or outflow of the visitors in this case let's select myeongdong again as our destination and check the movement patterns of domestic tourists here we try to answer the question where did domestic visitors come from to visit myeongdong in the whole month of October 2020. so we see that most visitors are from different districts around Seoul except one that you see under the one in the blue that is the gyeongji province which is still pretty near from Seoul maybe around 40 to 50 minutes by car so we can see that for the month of October most people came from nearby areas on the other hand let's check the outsole so where did domestic visitors go to after visiting myeongdong so here again lots of people majority of the visitors remained in the same city of Seoul and actually made that this district that myeongdong is in so 31.3 remain at the jungle district of Seoul here are some examples on how this solution has been used in Korea first Katie and the Korea tourism organization or the made an agreement to invigorate domestic tourism industry and for five years kit has analysed the trend of domestic and foreign travellers and has been integrating the results to its tourism policies the second case is analysis of local tourist spot for example there was a project to increase the number of tourists in hangman cave a tourist site in Korea using kit tourism analysis solution kit has identified routes to nearby tourist areas and reorganized bus routes that link the spots and here are some examples on how the solution has been used to analyse domestic tourism in Korea and this is a pre-existing report done by the using kit’s data and analysing the domestic tourism market amitotic 19. So here this is a representation for the period January 27 to November 15. overall we see a negative relationship between confirmed cases and the number of visitors so when new cases are high people are reluctant to travel around Korea has had two covet 19 waves so far although at the current time we are on our third wave unfortunately but aside from these times when the country experienced spikes in the covet cases the government was able to contain the spread of the virus relatively well and there have been two instances where we observed a positive year in your change in terms of the number of visitors throughout the period so one is week 17 that's April 27 to May 3 and the second one is week 39 September 28 to October 4. so for the week 17 this was the so-called golden week of Korea one of the biggest holidays in the country and the week 39 wherein it experienced a 13 percent uh year in year change this was the this was chuseok or the Korean thanksgiving day this is usually when families travel to their provinces or hometowns for the week for or the weekend at least so in both holidays Koreans would usually travel abroad but given the ongoing pandemic and travel restrictions people remained in the country and here we see visitor and expenditure trends after the outbreak overall of course on the left most we see the nationwide average for the period under study then we see data for all 17 administrative districts of Korea on average visitors and spending dropped 19 and 27 respectively and most impact on the number of visitors was felt by Seoul with a drop of 29 while the most impact in terms of expenditure was experienced by Incheon by 49 and all 17 administrative districts experienced contraction both in terms of visitors and expenditure but this experience was less severe in provincial areas so these are the seven provinces enclosed in the orange box next let's dive into the expenditure data to see how people spending patterns have changed ever since the covet 19 outbreak in the country this is a nationwide data again for the same period and the credit card data was used to extract consumption data all tourism businesses experienced negative growth except golf course and rent car businesses so golf course grew by 17 while rent car businesses grew by 62 which is pretty impressive but then travel agencies and duty-free shops are experiencing the sharpest decline so overall tourism-related industries in Korea were no exemptions and experiencing the negative effects brought by the pandemic so yeah with that end my presentation for today and thank you so much for your kind attention thank you so much and Trevor for your excellent presentations it was really insightful to see what can be done with big data let me now go to the panel discussion and have the great honour to welcome a very distinguished panel today uh let me introduce first to you the three panellists we have a first miss Sandra carvalho Sandra is the chief of tourism market intelligence and competitiveness at the world tourism organization since June 2018 before that she was the chief of communications and publications as well as deputy chief at unwrap with market trends competitiveness and trade in the tourism services department prior to joining the unto in 2003 Sandra worked for the Portuguese national tourist office in Lisbon Sandra has a degree in national relations by the Universidad technical agency and a postgraduate degree in marketing by the universe that completes the Madrid second Mr Mario hardy Mario is the coo of the pacific Asia travel association pata since November 2014 pata is a not-for-profit membership association that catalyses on responsible development of travel and tourism within the Asia pacific region Mario is the past chairman of the board of trustees of the pata foundation Mario has over 30 years of experience in specialized aviation businesses focusing on data analytics and technology coupled with several corporate leadership capacities and he currently serves on various advisory boards Mario has also received an honorary doctorate of letters from campillana university in 2016 for his philanthropic work in Cambodia and third Mr Ricky hoy Ricky has been the deputy director of the Macau government tourist office since 2018 he supervised the organizational planning and development department as well as a tourism product and event events department he joined in 1990 and served as head of the licensing division from April 2009 to march 2015 and then as head of the organizational planning and development department Ricky holds a bachelor of business administration degree in business information systems from the Macau university of science and technology so a very well wrong welcome to you all let me start with Sandra in the presentation that we have just seen by Trevor we heard that there are a lot of difference between traditional statistics and big data my question to you is how do you see these two come together and let's uh assume a government doesn't have enough money to really fully developing one of those what should they do first um aim for that traditional statistics or already start developing the big data over to you centred thank you very much Matthias good afternoon everyone and good morning depending on where you see us today um and thank you to Trevor and Juan t for the great presentations that they just shared um would start by saying that one should never eliminate the priority of the other traditional statistics have a concept of reliability and comparability that are critical for policy and big data which has emerged in in recent years should be and should work as a complement um to that uh traditional statistics um ’ll give you um an example from our side at the world tourism organization we work with governments around the world to improve their statistical capabilities but at the same time we work to make sure that they can leverage big data into either improving that traditional statistics in terms of time availability in terms of comparability as well but at the same time for example domestic tourism domestic tourism that has now been one of the priorities and probably will be in the year to come is one of the areas that traditional statistics needs to be improved because there's still huge gaps so working with big data can actually complement that information as we have seen um in the fantastic presentation from Korea as long as we define the methodology very clearly how do we identify a resident and a tourist within the big data how can we actually match the two to make sure that they're complement and think there's also an important point in what you were mentioning is the holistic approach to destination management many of the data or either big data or statistics that we need might not be tourism specifically we were just hearing in the presentation by Trevor the issue of resources use those are data often that are also available in other sources so for tourism to work in a holistic approach it's key to really have the full picture of the impact that we want to know about tourism in a destination thank you very much Sandra and so let's assume um the government wants to build up a market intelligence system to basically capture these different um sources of data and intelligence uh in your opinion what does it take to build up such a market intelligence system and at the national level but also at the local level well think the first one is putting it as a priority think it's very important that either if you're a national government or a local government that measuring is one of your priorities if that doesn't happen from the start then it's not going to translate into actions the second one would say is a cross-cutting approach to that market intelligence system or travel system as we have seen in the presentation from Korea which is you need to bring all the players together the public sector the private sector at national and local level but also the different administrations you need to bring the transport ministry together you need to bring finance you need to bring foreign affairs because tourism penetrates in each of these areas so a lot of the data that you actually need probably sometimes is already there you just need to identify it would say the third point is that you define your KPI very strongly and very clearly if you don't know what you want to measure from the start then you have to implement such a system and the fourth point would say is then go into identifying the available sources identifying the resources that you need not only the technical resources but human resources think um in the beginning there was a comment that the tourism industry is probably still behind in in some of these areas compared to other sectors and think we need to invest in in talent we need to invest in training in many destinations um there are a lack of human resources who are capable of managing and developing the systems and the last point think it's very important is um to make sure that national and local level are coordinated so that there's no duplication of efforts and that the learnings can be used by everyone sometimes there are obviously indicators which you will have available at local level that you don't have of national and vice versa but it's very important that can be a system of coordination as Mr butler mentioned in the beginning for example you end up with your network of sustainable tourism observatories looks into the different pillars economic social and environmental of the impact of tourism and there are many examples of destinations where using big data to actually measure such impacts and the last point would say is the importance of having actionable insights because you can have a lot of data you can have a lot of information but if you don't transform those into policy or into action then it's just investing in a system um ’d like to share one of the examples of our observatories which is the Buenos Aires who's built a very good market intelligence system and for example they identified the failures that the comments from the users in terms of accommodation and most of the comments were very much in line with the need for refurbishment of hotels which led into the opening by the Buenos Aires government of a specific line of financing for hotels refurbishment so think it's important that we don't miss the point of insights need to be used for a specific policy objective so with that would um would leave it here thank you Matthias thank you very much so let me now turn to Mario and uh just to let you know the audience can always ask questions please either raise your hand or put your question in the chat box and then will ask questions to our panel Mario um in our forthcoming report and it is stated that it's important to establish an environment that incentivizes the private sector to work with the public and create a win-win scenario and know it's a tricky um question on how to best do that but would like to pick your brain and tell us a little bit more how these pops can happen and what are the possible risks involved in those pops sure thank you matt yes probably the best way to answer this question is by actually giving you an example of what happens when you don't so this is a real case uh story but you know will keep the destination anonymous although think some of you might actually guess which one it is so several years ago one destination was a victim of her their own success they were so good at promoting the destination that they actually ended up doubling their number of tourists at the destinations itself in a very short time space and they woke up one morning and the sewage was actually overflowing into the street electricity was cutting down all the time they ran out of water and they actually had aircraft parked in the ground with no rooms available for actually putting these tourists in because they're all sold out so the destination was literally sold out um what happened is the destination was really successful at developing a very good marketing campaign and promoting themselves and et cetera but never actually shared this plan with the other divisions of the government they never inform the people that are managing the infrastructure managing waste management managing the electricity energy and water consumption and all this of their plan that actually that the if should they be successful the population on the island if your account for the tourists would double and therefore able to manage uh the capacity during that period of time so that's what happened when actually one the private sector or the public sector goes in and do something without actually talking to the other relevant divisions and departments the partnership is critical and this could have easily happened also where the private sector would could have gone on and actually do a really good job at marketing themselves without necessarily involving the government so the situation is not unique either republic or private it happens in both ways so this is one example out of many where collaboration is absolutely necessary ’ve also seen the opposite where uh the lack of success was the fact that actually there were no collaborations between private and public because one end was marketing something the other was marketing something under destination and ended up with conflicting messages into the marketplace where the traveller what they can find with this nation and end up going somewhere else um so the collaboration is actually critical and the collaboration is not only between public and private would say also collaboration is also critical between government departments themselves as the example gave you before where there was a lack of communication with other divisions of the department we at pata were invited a few years ago two years ago to do an assessment of developing tourism in a would say practically virgin destination where the number of tourists at the destination on the island was only 899 tourists per year um it's a fantastic opportunity for someone to look at developing tourism from essentially from scratch from nothing and how you can actually develop sustainable sustainably over a period of time and result responsibly but in that assessment we had to do all the things just talked about understanding what is the water consumptions and what are available on the island what is the energy consumption available on the island what is actually the situation in terms of waste management and what does this nation wants to be wants to be known for what type of tourists do you want how many can you accommodate on the island what is your maximum capacity what is the ideal capacity for the destination but this would only been possible by having conversations with all parts of the government as well as all the different sectors within the private sectors of the hospitality the uh transportations uh the tours and activities and developing sustainable products uh so ’ve said it since the day joined pata that you know it is critical that uh public and private partnership really work hand in hand in developing a destination responsibly and sustainably thank you very much Mario you just mentioned the environment and these negative externalities from tourism um so we also heard them that big data comes from the tourism sector itself but when it comes to those externalities how can we actually leverage big data to better measure those that that would be interesting to know Mario with the youth sure Sandra mentioned it a little bit before too that many of these data sets are actually already available within the governments they're just not available to tourists to tourism but they're available in other parts of the government uh the co2 emission for example the amount of waste being generated uh the energy consumptions of water consumption uh the economic impact the job impact also all of those needs to be actually taken account when you look at your tourism policies for the long term in your tourism development it's not only you know the arrivals and the spending data which are critical and you need to continue to be measured but you also need to include other data sets that are available within your governments they may not be available to your department at the moment and that's a question of you know sometimes just reaching out to other divisions of the governments or working to your ministry more closely and developing better relationships with other divisions of the government to develop a central data set that can be used and pull from other parts and we hear from Ricky later on to how Macau’s doing it and they have a really good system and how they actually aggregating data from other divisions of the government to make their strategy better moving forward thank you so with that let me turn to Ricky you have prepared a short presentation that um showcases um what you're currently doing with big data so the floor is yours for five ten minutes Ricky you're muted Ricky you're muted Ricky you have to unmute we can't help you hello yes yeah okay good morning and good afternoon everyone this is Ricky from the Macau government tourism office i'm very happy to be invited to the webinar and to talk about the big data and the tourism recovery have just prepared a small presentation so we'll show you the presentation and then we'll come back for the discussion uh for those who are not very familiar with Macau probably when you [Music] when we talk about Macau the first thing you can think of maybe is the casino yes indeed Macau was a was somebody called Macau the oriental the Orlando Monte Carlo but actually we though we are a very small city but we are a tourism destination will many different kind of entertainment for example the world class hotels we are also inscribed on the Enesco heritage site since 2005 and in 2017 we come become a member of the Enesco creativity network we are the city of gastronomy member even though the big portion of the government income is still from the gaming site but yes so we will see the tourism industry is a very important economic period of Macau during the past month the epidemic yeah give a very severe hit to Macau but think the mace government is doing quite a good job to fight the Korean 19 pandemic so far we have only 46 confirmed community cases and the last case happened on 25th of June that means we are almost more than five months we don't have any cabernets here in Macau when our city becomes safe we plan to launch some measure to help the recovery of the tourism sector one measure that can share with you is what we call the Macau radical e-coupon platform of course the objective is to stimulate the spending on the tourism industry and to and to support the local economy we are offering this platform to the local shops free of charge and the shops they are free to give any discount in whatever format they think appropriate so far we have run the platform for more than six months and now we have already the 670 merchants on the platform and the discounted items are almost 2000 and the discount coupon downloaded by the tourist and the local people has more than 200 000 so why mentioned this platform here what does it do with the back data would say traditionally we will distribute the coupon in print format in paper coupon for example at the entry point at the hotel at the restaurant it says stretcher but now this time we use the e coupon format so what is the advantage of using the e coupon this this is the most advantage is we can easily collect information the data of what the result of the or of the discount cube one with the traditionally with the with the traditionally with the paper coupon it's very difficult to collect data of how the coupons are distributed how they are used but with this one platform we can at any time easily collect information and the situation of the coupons for example we can easily count how many coupons are downloaded by the tourists in what category they are they are they are they are in whatever they are and how they are used et cetera et cetera uh yes uh we are still running the platform we don't have uh we are now still in the data capturing stage uh we don't have uh much actual usage of big data of this from this platform yet but we certainly we know that this platform will help us to plan for the next stage of the strategy for example one objective of our strategy is prolong the leaning of stay of the tourists so in this from the from this preliminary result we collect we can say the download coupon in the accommodation category is about 40 is about 40 percent but the discount item we offer are just only 12 percent so with this kind of information we can adjust our measure in the next phase for example we can the government may subside more on the hotel on the hotel product so as to attract more tourists who can stay here in Macau for one more night and another item that would like to share with you is how we use spectator to enhance the business travel experience when talking about this item have to mention that since December 9 2019 the mace government already launched an open data platform this is a what we call a smart city project cooperate with the alibaba crown of mainland china in this platform many government builds they contribute data to this platform and these data are free to be used by the public of course this open data creates many values in different aspects but one point would like to highlight is with the open data platform we it turns to make some new product or service it becomes possible one application that would like to share with you is this smart trip planner this is also a cooperation of the mace government and the alibaba group uh the trip plan it applies to the air technologies and it uses the data in the open data platform that just mentioned so that we can suggest an itinerary for the tourist and of course at the same time when we suggest an itinerary for the tourists is able to collect the user behaviour from the street planner and then we with this data that we with this feedback data is very good for us to have an in-depth analysis at the at later stage just stumped several screens laptops from the trip planner so to share with you so that you can have a more concrete idea for how the treatment is doing this trip banner was launched two weeks ago is a very new system and sorry that we only have a chinese version now but the English version will be coming very soon so at the very beginning we will ask the user how many days they want to stay here in Macau and what is his or her interesting point for example she wants to he wants to visit the cultural sites or they want to have a relaxed trip to enjoy the local food here in Macau and then based on the interest of the users the trip planner we recommend we think this is the most ideal trip but of course the user can always do some customization of the trip and during the trip when they turn on the tree panel again we will always promote an interesting pure ice in neighbouring areas this could be a restaurant can be a museum or can be an exhibition houses when the user click on one location for example in for example a museum of course the trip planner will give them the some basic description of the museum like the operation hours some photos something like that because the trip panel is linked it's connected to the database so we can always have the latest news to the user for example the museum due to an emergency maintenance the museum may be closed today this kind of latest news will be sent to the user [Music] and again because the true planner is linked to the database we can even offer some real-time data to them to the user for example when the user moves from one location to the other we the treatment will recommend the bus route to him and because all the public prices here in Macau are already equipped with the GPS system so exactly we have the real time data of rear buses e so in this case we can also arise we can also advise the user the available time of the next pass and so that they can have a better planning of time and go to the bus stop on time think this is the end of my presentation just to conclude sorry that we don't have much concrete cases of using big data to help them tourism recovery but just like the speakers in the previous section say we all believe big data will be a very good tools and they can give a very useful contribution to the future development of the tourism industry thank you thank you so much Ricky very interesting presentation and think Macau is really at the forefront of this development let me just ask you two questions the first one is about data privacy because you said that you basically can follow these tourists around the city so of course this raises questions about data privacy so how does Macau ensure data privacy uh yes we do have our law to regulate data privacy in 2005 we the what we call the personal data protection law was came into enforcement in 2005. since Macau was a Portuguese colony this personal data protection law was originated from a from the European legislation system and will say it has a very strict regulation on using the personal data and very strict regulator on the data piracy for example take back the trip plan when the user launched the we have to ask for their consent that we collect their personal data if they don't give the they don't give the consent we won't do any collection of data and even they do the consent we can collect the data we have to by the law by this regulation we have to take out all personal data for example when the user is using a website to run the we have to take out the IP address if he is using the mobile phone we have to take out the mobile number we have to take out the main address code so that which means we cannot collect any identification text from the data and this is think this is a very uh how to say this is a very good protection of data piracy okay excellent another question that have is about your collaboration with alibaba cloud and because think other governments also would like to engage more with the private sector um so what has your experience been uh when working with the private sector uh what have been some of the challenges that you were facing uh-huh yes here Macau when we talk about cooperation with the product sector usually we will we will face two extreme cases one on the one hand for those integrated resource for example the sense growth for example to win because this kind of what we call the international enterprise usually they will have sufficient support to the to the government measure so uh the cooperation with this kind of big enterprise we the cooperation will be very smooth but on the other hand when dealing with the this will bring in quite a lot of won't say problem but quite a lot of barriers to overcome for example when let's get back to the back data because we understand when talking about big data usually it all involves the technology right so here for this kind of for this kind of project of course the has to install extra equipment otherwise they won't be able to use any new technology and investment of course is one thing we have to consider and the second thing is the training we have to provide sufficient training to the shops employees so that they can know they know how to operate those kind of equipment and another very particular case here in Macau is many traditional shops are still owned and operated by some aged people these kind of people they used it to run the business in their own way and would say they don't have very high intention of using technologies this is also another challenge that we are facing that's very interesting this question of inclusion also how to make sure that everybody can benefit from the intelligence that you'd generate through big data we have about 10 minutes left for uh questions so please feel free to um raise your hand or put the question in the in the chat box um otherwise would like to go back to Sandra think this question about you know inclusive usage of big data is an important one what's your view on that Sandra on the inclusiveness of big data well think it comes to what was mentioning before in terms of resources think it's very important that there is increased collaboration at national level because you will have destinations which have the capability either financial or human to develop it and others who don't so think there's an important role to be played by the national government to ensure that there's a national would say more than big data would say a truly measurement oriented policy that can either include big data or it can include traditional statistics think and always insist on this think management of tourism because of the different impact it has on different levels is so cross-cutting that if you don't have an holistic national approach it's going to be very difficult but at the same time it's very good to see some of the destinations who are leading that can also help others and think for that you need to have a strong public collaboration as it was mentioned and let me go to Mario just again about this collaboration with the private sector because also he um in we have approached the private sector and tried to get some data from them but we didn't find this color collaboration very straightforward because of course a lot of these uh data providers they for them it's their core business they're not always willing to easily share even a small part of that data so what is your advice to governments to approach the private sector and to actually start a collaboration with them Mario over to you sorry excuse me once one second is the internet one moment yes we can hear you okay good sorry i'm having issues with internet so just switched to 4g um the yeah can can definitely understand what you're saying was one of them before one of those companies who process data and who government approached to get access to freely to the information and the answer is yes if you have money because we're a commercial entity and therefore the data we aggregate mean just to give you an idea to aggregate the data we were processing the annual cost operational cost of aggregating this information was in excess of 20 million dollars uh so you can imagine that actually it's we also as a business as a corporation we also have to recoup our own costs and obviously our shareholders expect to see some returns at the same at the end of the day however believe there are actually ways to work with many of these uh private sector organizations um and maybe in different ways and collaborating many of them are also equally interested in uh finding alternative additional customers within our sectors um and in ways of doing partnership introductions uh and helping them to grow their business in a different way with uh with a limited access where the information is used for maybe internally and not distributed externally we at pata have formed some of these partnership with some organizations where we do have access to the information to help us guide us inform our members to make better decisions moving forward but we do not have the right to actually share that information the detail of it with the members because if they want to they can go and purchase it and do their own analysis so think there's ways to collaborate you have to be creative in your approach and be flexible in the way you work with them but i'm sure Sandra’s got similar experience also see her nodding and know that her and have had similar experience with private partners too so Sandra would like to add something or yeah no think that's a very important point think there's two big issues here um think there's um you know the concept of big data for good would say and there's been an interesting discussion in some destinations when the um the over tourism issue rose which is do public entities um have the right to at least have a minimum data with no cost because it is for public sector management um and there are actually destinations even thinking about regulating that so think you know it's an interesting it's an interesting discussion um the other point is what Mario mentioned obviously making sure that that data is collected uh processed and intelligibly available it's a huge cost so um think partnerships are the key but think forum destinations as well um there's maybe an opportunity for bigger collaboration um maybe at a regional level maybe at uh you know national different demos coming together to reduce those costs because um unfortunately think often the negotiations are very on a one-to-one basis um and if maybe you have a pool of destinations coming together maybe the conditions can be better as well so think there's different ways to approach it and as Mario said as well you have different layers of information for example we're now partnering with several companies and we have a unwed recovery tracker tool in our website which is free access to everyone where you can have information for in terms of occupancy rates trends in hotel searches in hotel bookings in airline capacities but you have that at a regional or sub-regional level you don't have it at destination so think there's different layers of information which can also be useful thank you very much Sandra we have one question that was put in a chat box um the question is do you see any difference of tourism intelligence adoption between established or majored tourism markets and emerging economies how policymakers and market players are ready for implementation of big data and tourism so think the question is about do we see difference in terms of um the usage of big data across countries who would like to take that question yeah maybe Sandra or Mario sure can can start Sandra i'm sure can add later on um the there is a huge difference there's a difference in terms of the capability the skill set that are actually available in the respective destination management on in understanding how to interpret the information and how to actually use information but there's also a huge gap in terms of the finances the money available to have the right tools to be able to process that information in a way that actually helps make better decision um ’ve seen both hands ’ve seen destinations such as Macau with Ricky or Singapore Hong Kong who have got a very sophisticated platform ’ve got data scientists working for the destination ’ve got really fascinating tools as we've seen also with Korea to help to guide and make these decisions and they've been trained they've got right individuals they have the right tool sets to help them and ’ve seen the completely opposite of this the other extreme where uh someone's got a three ten-year-old laptop trying to process something on a on an excel sheet and get data cards from the immigration office on sometime twice a year and have thousands and thousands to process manually and will go to it and then you receive the data uh a year later uh so you you've got the two extreme here in terms of the capabilities of the different destinations and think the emerging destinations or the smaller ones or the one really needs some help at the moment to give them the proper tools the proper training to help them to elevate them to a better standard moving forward very good Sandra you would like to add something yeah thank you Matthias thank you Mario think would add two points one reinforcing what Mario was saying the need to support those less resource destinations and think this is the fantastic platform to think about how in step maybe we can help those destinations in two ways one make it sustainable also and this comes to the human resources point and the technological point because you can develop fantastic systems with you know emerging destinations but they need to be able to sustain them in the future so we need to be able to train people to identify talent and that talent sometimes is very expensive and also tourism needs to be an attractive field to work in compared to others for data scientists and think this is a very key point for us and the second one is also the opportunity to leverage country to country collaboration so for those countries which are more advanced as Mario mentioned Singapore or Macau or Korea to actually also think about collaboration and cooperation in technical assistance in this area think often technical assistance has been implemented in many other areas and this is probably a new one that we need to think about as well so think there's a huge opportunity to learn from each other and to support each other here thank you very much about two three minutes left are there any questions from the floor otherwise will maybe ask one last question to the three panellists a very short one um since the three of you are at the pulse of the tourism sector and you've been um looking into a lot of data what's actually your outlook for the tourism sector for 2021 just in 30 seconds maybe ’ll start with Sandra again that's the most challenging question of the last one hour and a half 30 seconds think obviously the news of the vaccine has to be a game changer and think we need to now see the implementation of the vaccination um would say we still have at least another challenging year ahead and think we need to be prepared for that but think if you look back six months ago then we're more positive than we were that said think the sector is still in very challenging moments it needs higher support to navigate until we're back into a level that was the pre pandemic level and from our side at unto we still see that we need at least two years and a half two to three years to actually be there and we need to support the sector as we go through um think it's very important and we often reinforce that we need bigger cooperation between government in terms of travel restrictions because this is the biggest challenge we see when travel restrictions are addressed that the demand is there people want to travel but we need to achieve that and think we cannot forget going through the vaccination that we need to implement the systems to manage the information on vaccinated travellers now because otherwise in a year time where a big part of the population might be already vaccinated the systems will not be in place so think it's a moment to step up that international and regional collaboration thank you very much Sandra Ricky yes your outlook for next year when looking at 2021 think it will still be a very difficult year but we all should look at the bright side of it uh here in Macau think we are a little lucky why say that because mainland china is our major source market and we all know china they have a very good control of the [Music] academic situation there and next year though we all have to work hard and harder and but we all look very we are very optimistic that um more tourists for mainland china will come to Macau and hope our tourism situation will have a big recovery in the next thank you thank you Ricky Mario ’ll keep it short a very slow and gradual recovery but some glimpse of hope that things will get better but it will take time thank you very much thank you so much to all the panellists think we had a very insightful and interesting discussion and that covered many topics within this big data and tourism area that brings you to the end of this webinar thanks so much for participating and just uh on one last point on um big data and tourism we going to all see one tutorial coming to many of our houses very soon namely we'll talk about how to leverage big data for tourism recovery it is the first joint knowledge event that the ad is organizing together with the un world tourism organization we're very excited about this new partnership and we are looking forward to a strong effective collaboration ahead let me quickly turn to the topic of the today's webinar we have started to think about the big data and how to utilize the big data for the tourism industry already before the coving 19 pandemic we realized while the private sector has moved fast in collecting and utilizing big data the public sector has been rather slow in taking advantage of big data for policy making big data has a huge potential to improve tourism policy and management especially as the pandemic has hit the tourism industry so hard and many uncertainties exist we need to be quick on our big data which is often available with the short time lag very high frequency can make an important contribution to successful recovery of the tourism industry after COVID over the past months we have collaborated with a number of experts including those from unto to better understand the potential of big data and how to use it best for our opportunities today we will present the preliminary findings of a joint ad unto report on big data and tourism this report will show how the public and private sector can create a win-win scenarios and use big data to maximize its full potential it is it will also show how to leverage big data for the recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic let me stop here and introduce our very distinguished guest Mr Manuel butler executive director of the un world tourism organization Mr butler is the executive director of unto since June 2018 prior to joining the unto he was the CEO of tourespania twice between 2012 and 2013 and 2016 and 2018 he was also the president of the European travel committee in 2013. he has been working in the management position in the public and private sector in the western Europe as well as north and Latin America Mr butler the floor is yours thank you very much see john park director of the red fashion development bank good afternoon to everyone good morning to a couple of us they are here in Europe it is a pleasure working alongside the   think is more than me that is a must one of the clear lessons to be learned from the pandemic is the importance of resilience planning and obviously need to work on the basis of network logic working jointly both institutions adv. and unto is an excellent example this webinar shows the importance of working together and using big data we are living in an unprecedented change in paradigm we know becoming four years in central to build altogether the future of the tourism is leaving his childhood behind and transitioning into adulthood means taking responsibilities and at the same time are more complex there is a structure is more and more complex specifically regarding the value chains and in business operations more complexity means a higher need of evidence-based decisions on better understanding the potential of big data companies are already on the front line of issues such as already having exploiting the increasing amount of big data the public sector needs also to use the generated bid data by the tourism industry to better manage a more and more sustainable and inclusive tourism the unto recommendations for actions for action and guidelines to restart tourism calling for urgent and strong support to help the global team sector not only recover from the unprecedented challenge of the Quebec 19 but to grow back better in these recommendations big data plays a key role such investing in data and in market intelligence systems to monitor behaviour anticipate trends and adjust product design and marketing strategies evidence-based decisions and strategies are key particularly the moments of crisis investing in data analysis and partnerships allow for close short-term monitoring of tourism development and impact we have to generate data support setting up and growing up our network of national and local sustainable trends observatories the so-called insta network to measure all dimensions of tourism we're in partnership with relevant stakeholders and we share this information with the sector building back better requires there is to embrace a holistic vision of sustainability build new and better measurements and promote changes in policy governance financing private behaviour and business models and in this context big data is one of the pillars for going ahead   hope this webinar helps in the sense to build back a better tourist for the well-being of tourists and local population alive alike thank you very much again to the ash and the block bank giving us this opportunity to working together thank you very much to all and   wish a very a successful webinar thank you thank you Mr butler let me now introduce our presenters today uh first presentation will be delivered by Mr Trevor welt man whose partner clickable impact consulting group his presentation will be about big data for better tourism policy and management Trevor is the immediately passed chief operating officer of the pacific Asia travel association called pata where he used to oversee the day-to-day operations of the association across its three offices in Bangkok Beijing and London and also spearheaded the creation of the pata crisis resource centre Trevor has over 10 years of experience in Asia covering china Vietnam and Thailand at present Trevor is a partner at clickable impact consulting group an interdisciplinary consultancy focused on the sustainable development goals following Trevor’s presentation our consultant Juan he chow will make a presentation on revitalizing the tourism industry through big data is currently she is currently the senior economics research associate of the economic research and the regional cooperation department she's conducting economic research on tourism so Trevor you have 20 minutes and then one year will pro provide another 10 minute presentation so the floor is yours Trevor thank you very much dry park   did do a run through this morning it was 20 minutes and 10 seconds so if i'm a touch over 20 minutes please uh please excuse me it will be done quickly so hello everybody thank you for having me i'm going to go ahead and share my screen but i'm admittedly not uh a power teams user i'm more of a zoom guy so i'm going to just try to get this set up and make sure it will work and get my notes in a line and then we will go from there so let me get it up and looking okay can somebody confirm can you see my screen yes you can okay thank you Matthias okay good afternoon and good morning uh ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for having me here big thank you to dry park and Mr butler for the warm introductions and for also including pot in this great initiative so my name is Trevor welt man and today i'm here to talk about big data for better tourism policy management and the sustainable recovery from covid19 as mentioned by dry park just want to be clear at the beginning that this is a preliminary finding so today's presentation is based on a report that ad had and unto had commissioned from pata that pata had actually consulted on so these are the preliminary findings that have not received comment yet from ad and until though we're quite confident in in what we're presenting with that in mind uh it's a lot of information to pack into 20 minutes the report itself is over 90 pages so i'm actually going to try to give a high level understanding of what is the true role of big data and digitalization in the future of tourism and then at the end i'm going to give some practical context for how big data is helping us so the first part i'm just going to quickly touch on the context and impact of covet 19 on the industry for the second part i'm going to talk about this idea of how big data is going to help us create these smart destinations of the future and for the final part as   shared i'm going to give some insights into the role of big data in covet 19 recovery and the sustainable future of tourism so before   get into the presentation though   do want to ask what is our goal why are we even talking about tourism or why are we even talking about big data and tourism   think it's important to say at the beginning that what our goal is not or what our goal is not only our goal for big data is not only for marketing and product development it's not only to better leverage our online platforms and digitalization and it's also not only for COVID 19 recovery although it is an urgent issue that we need to pay attention to as i'm sure many of you saw this political cartoon make its rounds on Facebook or on social media at the beginning part of the year we have to keep in mind that the crisis facing the tourism industry is not simply about the short-term needs to revive the industry from covet 19. we need to use COVID 19 as the springboard to help us combat climate change you know just as an example if some of the sea level reports that  ’ve seen come true over the next few years those of us based in Bangkok manila Jakarta our livelihoods are at risk say nothing of the tourism ministries the significant tourism industries that these destinations house so we need to make sure that when we talk about big data and tourism we also have that long-term vision about tourism-driven sustainable infrastructure that is how do we turn tourism into a foremost driver of the sustainability resilience and inclusiveness agendas and we do that by building these smart destinations and i'm going to touch on this in much more detail as the presentation goes forward so before we even get too deep into big data there's plenty that we have to do in order to help the industry come back and respond to the perils of covid19 and in fact we've pulled just a couple sentences from our overall policy recommendations at the end of the report we've written uh it's important to say that you know we need the holistic accounting we need to build up the local capacity of our destination managers we need new blended finance for uh sustainable infrastructure and for the sums but we also need to know how to do it and that's what i'm going to talk about now is how can big data help us build those smart destinations and then how is big data going to help us achieve everything on this list not only for the recovery from covet 19 but to the sustainable development of the industry to perpetuity so this is going to bring me to the second part of my presentation today which is tourism big data and creating smart destinations so before we can talk about where we want to go to the smart destinations we have to better understand where we're coming from and that's the traditional tourism statistics and we also have to give credit where credit is due this list of numbers basically contained on this table are responsible for helping drive the industry forward over the last 50 years to becoming the global economic juggernaut that it is this is a list of specific airline data hotel data arrivals data demographic based market research economic impact analysis as well as some transportation data and again by using these as the north star metrics for the industry we see that 10.3 percent of global gap and the 330 million jobs around the world supported that being said our traditional tourism statistics have limitations these are considered small data in most destinations as they're reliant mostly on the census and survey in terms of methodology for collection believe it or not in most destinations particularly in our region this is still a heavily analogy process it's not yet digitized meaning that these are time and resource intensive and beyond the time and resource intensively they're not available on demand there's a significant lag between the collection time the processing time and then ultimately the publication time to market so to cover some of those limitations of the traditional tourism statistics the industry has started to work with what we're going to call traditional tourism big data providers now this is actually a catch-all term for many things but being honest when people talk about traditional tourism big data they're really just referring to the online travel platforms these can come in in a few different categories  ’ve tried to break them out here but essentially online travel refers the platforms we use when we book our holidays our vacation rentals our flights ride hailing etc. and just to give an overview i'm sure most people on call use at least one of these brands when booking their travel if not for research than the actual booking this is an incomplete list of about 20 20 providers that are the prominent providers globally but already this list represents over a hundred billion dollars of revenue per year so that starts to give us an understanding of the true size and scope of online travel furthermore over fifty percent of bookings around the world are now taking place online which again given the numbers of the industry starts to show the true size of this data so what are the benefits that we receive when we work with traditional tourism big data there's the billions of data points this can actually help us monitor demand in bookings in real time it gives us these deep cross-border and cross-sector consumer insights that our small data cannot provide as Mr butler shared at the beginning we start to get that enhanced marketing breach and targeting the great product development from those feedback loops of the enhanced behaviour analysis of our target consumers and then importantly to dispersal campaigns which is a great a great tool in the toolkit of destination managers to be able to leverage these platforms and their marketing capability to entice tourists to go to new and different destinations instead of constantly concentrating in a limited number of places now i'm going to say this with a smile because actually this slide represents about a quarter of the report that we wrote and   could go   could we could probably teach a semester in a university on this slide alone about the limitations and challenges of traditional tourism big data so i'm not going to go into too much of detail on this because even though it's a focus of the report it's not the focus of the presentation today suffice it to say that traditional tourism big data has its opportunities but we have challenges some of them are technical in terms of the selectivity bias the continuity the debt invisibles some of them are based on the skills of our destination managers or the resources in terms of cost available to our destinations but again   put this to show that there are limitations and challenges to using it but it's not a focus instead this is actually the focus of today's presentation and it's this that actually both the traditional tourism statistics and tourism big data have a primary limitation and it's this they have an implicit growth agenda and that growth agenda is implicitly economic it looks towards the economic success of the industry without wholly accounting for the environmental and social uh issues in the industry so again with the second point they do not account for the invisible burden of tourism which are these tourism externalities and so in short if our industry wants to become sustainable it will never become a driver of sustainability if these metrics continue to be the only north star metrics we use in destination planning so where did   get this idea for invisible burden it actually comes from this great report that was published in 2019 from pepperwood international Cornell university and the travel foundation and  ’ve condensed the report but essentially the focus are these unaccounted for externalities of tourism basically the unmeasured externality of tourists create hidden burdens on destinations environments societies and economies now these externalities are ultimately borne by the local communities where tourists operate and therefore call to question the unquestioned belief in tourism's net benefits  ’ve provided here a screenshot from the report so we can start to get a sense for what are some of those unaccounted for externalities emissions renewable energy costs renewable water sources and then a big oversight here which are the social cultural restoration and maintenance of a destination as a result of this invisible burden that same report gives us two solutions to look for to build back more sustainably it says first new holistic accounting systems that capture the full range of costs stemming from the growth of tourism are needed these will by the by taking into account the climate the habitat and the social costs of destinations hosting travellers and tourists but the key thing powering the holistic accounting are new data and technology sources that are measuring resource consumption to better protect the local environment and cultural heritage to benefit those communities as a result then what we've talked to and we focused on mostly to date as an industry has been these traditional tourism statistics and the traditional tourism big data whereas what we're hearing in the invisible burden and other reports too of course is to start shifting the focus over to management this means supplementing our tours our traditional tourism statistics and traditional tourism big data with smart cities big data to build those holistic accounting mechanisms or enhance metrics for sustainable outcomes to give us those smart destinations now what do   mean by smart cities big data these are the large networks of sensors used to monitor and track various municipal services typically using IOT or internet of things devices it could be mundane like car parking or noise monitoring or more profound in this instance to things like water usage traffic surveillance electricity use and air pollution i'm going to kind of bulk uh telecom data under smart cities big data here because it's IOT driven which our colleague is going to go into more detail with the next presentation about but suffice to say that there are big benefits to using these automated sources of big data first they're automated or they're designed to collect the data they're highly accurate as they show real usage in real time from what users are actually doing and these are practical data and insights actually tied to the management of a destination now what we've done at pod is we we've developed these are supposed to be green these two oops we've developed a uh a schematic here that says if a destination was actually going to be smart what would those data flows look like and how would those impact the investment flows so as you'll see here on the schematic we have these one-way and also two-way data flows between our infrastructure and our private and our public sector which are ultimately leading to enhanced investment decisions in sustainable tourism technology and infrastructure my apologies as these two arrows here are supposed to be green showing that the enhanced data flows are actually giving the enhanced infrastructure investments from the public sector and the private sector now the result of this then starts to answer that question   posed at the beginning of my presentation today which are what are those fundamental goals of tourism big data first we begin to understand truly the value and the cost on a per tourist basis and a destination or that invisible burden and second by understanding that true value and that true cost we get to make enhanced tourism-driven sustainable infrastructure investments that are more sustainable as well as better target our capacity development decisions and interventions for our destination managers and our trade okay so uh let me go to the next slide   understand that that was very condensed and also quite theoretical but again   want to make sure that we're seeing it for what it is it's not only the online platforms but the management of tourism is also going to be dependent on these new data streams from the smart cities data and IOT data with that in mind though   also want to be practical   want to show everybody now in this third part how big data is actually being used for covid19 recovery which   believe is also a focus of Juana’s presentation next so the first is   want to share the emerging strategy that we're seeing across destinations around the world related to traditional tourism big data being used for promoting domestic tourism we're seeing it in Macau we're seeing it in Singapore we're seeing it in Thailand where the destinations are partnering with these online platforms and then also providing deals and vouchers for redemption on those platforms to get their domestic populations out and actually engaging with their tours and businesses at this time of prolonged border closures very interestingly as well we're seeing a higher adoption of the uh the uh destinations using the payment options for these platforms which is very interesting meaning that they're actually supplying the vouchers to be redeemed on a on a weave chat or excuse me on a we pay or on a grad pay for them the businesses who maybe were not on the online platforms before in order to capture this domestic market it's forcing their own digitalization now they have to sign up to these platforms to receive those payments and   think Ricky’s uh Ricky hoy from Macau is going to go into more details in the panel discussion about this the next way that we're seeing big data assist with uh coveted recovery is actually helping with opening of borders and creating regional harmony you know pre-coveted 19 the industry was already making significant advances with the seamless travel agenda this is the use of technology notably biometrics and the use of a digital identity to enable a seamless and secure end-to-end travel traveller journey now early on in the crisis we heard a lot about we need health passports we need digital passports etc. since that early part of the crisis in the first part of this year this brand common pass this organization is sort of emerged as the leader or the winning health passport globally this is a project that's a collaboration between an NGO called the commons project backed by the Rockefeller foundation and the world economic forum essentially it's using block chain and import and interoperable technology to securely unite airports airlines health authorities immigration and travellers i'm just going to show you quickly how this works in essence in in destination or point of origin a traveller will get their lab test for coved or their vaccination certification that lab result using block chain will be sent securely to an app on their phone they will carry that with them by way of a QR code to the different checkpoints as they travel in October 2020 successful pilots already took place between the up and the us and Hong Kong and Singapore and in November importantly common pass was endorsed by the airport's consul international and the world's three major airline alliances sky team one world and star alliance so this is already up and running and we're going to continue to see more of this finally at the last part of my presentation today   want to share two models that have emerged from different sources about reimagining the future management of the travel and tourism industry not only through covid19 but also beyond the first model   want to share is from McKinney and this is their establishment of their idea of a tourism nerve centre now they've given four points that they believe all destinations should be paying attention to as they try to build back through the pandemic and into the future two of these their nerve centre and then this last point enabling a digital analytics transformation are heavily focused on big data this is the schematic from their article and  ’ve highlighted this part here that they call industry observatory but if you read it and you pay attention to how they build this this argument through their report they're just talking tours and big data essentially the destination needs to become the central spoke of data and analysis particularly big data to be able to get that information in centralize it analyse it kick it out to the trade so the trade can make better decisions at this time but also for their own policy development and governance to be able to make those better and enhanced decisions another model that's emerged is from the same author of the invisible burden report about earlier in my presentation which is what she has called a marshal plan for tourism can it be built like McKinney she's also advocating for a rethinking of how the destinations themselves are actually structured in terms of management and is proffering a four-part sustainable tourism investment hub it proctors an some fund a sustainable infrastructure fund the increased capacity building and technical assistance but really at the heart of it and her argument is the centre for destination information and technology this is that core hub that's building towards that holistic accounting those enhanced metrics for sustainable outcomes but in the short term in the covet period that data hub will be providing the information to get our sustainable infrastructure our some recovery and our capacity building fully off the ground so   have 15 seconds left i'm going to move to my conclusion today uh as   shared at the beginning look we can talk about this forever but really our goal is not only tourism big data from marketing and product development better leveraging of online platforms and digitalization and it cannot only be about covet 19 recovery we need to start thinking not only about the marketing side we need to springboard from that to the management side to reach our fundamental goals of tourism big data or the role that tourism big data can be in helping us build these smart destinations so we finally can start to understand the value and cost per tourist that invisible burden of tourism to ultimately give us the enhanced tourism-driven infrastructure investment and capacity development decisions remember this is a long-term crisis if we can accomplish this in and through covet 19 then we truly stand a chance to not only revive our industry but to turn tourism into a foremost driver of the sustainability resilience and inclusiveness agendas so with that   thank you all for your time today   took 20 minutes and 50 seconds not 10 seconds my apologies but you can email me anytime at this address if you have further questions and  ’ve also put a QR code for my for my LinkedIn so thank you all very much for your time today over to you Matthias and dry park thank you Trevor without further any uh do um can   turn to one he to make the presentation correct uh hello can you hear me yes we can hear you all right let me show my presentation first alright so uh good morning good afternoon wherever you are in the world   am janitor from the economic research and regional cooperation department of ad and   am pleased to present to you today on how we could use big data to understand tourism sector by ex-examining the case of republic of Korea   would like to say that this presentation is a joint effort between ad and Korea telecom or kit in short so first on behalf of our colleagues from kit let me introduce kit’s tourist analysis method and tourism analysis solution we know that reliable and timely performance analysis is essential for the tourism industry to develop further as a result kit has been very much focused on using mobile data to analyse tourism so please let me present to you the results of what kit has accomplished so far so what is the logic behind identifying tourists using mobile data kit uses the let signal data for tourist analysis most telos use the car or the call detail record data to measure the floating population however car data is only generated when a customer uses a call or sends a message so data is generated very irregularly and there is a large gap between data points on the other hand let signal data is generated very regularly every five minutes on an average even when a mobile phone is not being used and for this reason let data is more appropriate for accurate analysis of tourism patterns in fact it is able to generate seven thousand percent more data than car then how do we know who is a tourist and how does kit identify tourists so Katie defines a signal captured around the base station at a certain time as an entire population then by analysing the pattern of the users stay in the area kit categorizes it as a resident or non-resident when signals are regularly captured at the certain time zone kit defines them as residents on the other hand the non-resident population is examined further in order to filter out who are the tourists by analysing tourist patterns the tourist population is estimated among the tourist population kit further categorizes it as domestic or foreign tourists as for domestic tourists they can be estimated and segmented into resident and run non-resident from the entire population captured in base stations by applying statistical behaviour of tourists the criteria for defining a domestic tourist is the number of visit the visit to the tourist sites this criteria was established after analysing actual data short-term visit foreigners can be identified from kit’s roaming data the criteria for defining foreign tourists is the length of tourist visits and according to roaming data foreign tourists visiting Korea are expected to stay a maximum of 15 days so we use 15 days as a criteria to identify tourists in general one's carrier's data does not cover the entire population therefore kit applies statistical techniques to calculate the overall number of tourists and Katie attempts to build the representative population out of the sample collected in this case of domestic tourists it is calculated by considering the market share of telos in the case of four estimated the statistics of entry and departure required by countries in terms of accuracy through the verification processes domestic and foreign tourist data estimations result 95 and 75 respectively next   will introduce the tourism analysis solution kit has created so the travel intelligence platform or the trip is a platform that provides tourism statistics and tourism analysis using mobile and credit card data tourism statistics include detailed analysis of tourist visits tourist characteristics and length of visit by tourist site and festival period tourism analysis provide information by comparing the competitiveness of tourist sites in the five areas see eat buy stay and play and last but not the least tourism consulting supports local governments to address top challenges through reliable tourism statistics and analysis for the following slides   will briefly introduce the main features of chair so this is the main page of trip so when you enter the urn in your browser this is what you'll be seeing at the moment unfortunately the website is only supported in the Korean language most data in the platform are updated on a weekly basis here you may choose to look at data on a weekly or a monthly basis here let's examine the trends for the week of November 30 to December 6. when you select an area of interest you will be able to identify overall status of tourists so today let's check on one of the districts in the Seoul metropolitan city so here   click Seoul city then select jungle district it's one of the districts in the city on the right side of the map uh we'd be able to see the week on week changes in the number of visitors year and year changes and the breakdown on the number of visitors for the week that we're examining and we can also see the rankings under different categories let's check the tourist spot ranking so in the district of jungle myeongdong emerged as the number one tourist spot so   think for those who have visited Seoul i'm sure you might have gone to this area at least once during your trip so this is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Seoul especially for foreign visitors for shopping or for food and when   click this location you'll be able to see a detailed analysis result the size and characteristics of tourists can be identified by specific tourist sites so here we see that people in their 20s like to visit myeongdong the most between 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. most people come from another district of Seoul called then majority of the people remain in the same district jungle district after visiting myeongdong here you can also see the inflow and outflow into the certain area to identify movement patterns so in this case we are studying in terms of domestic tourists we can identify their gender age and place of residence on the other hand for foreign visitors we can identify their nationality so in this case jury two weeks ago 35.16 of the foreign visitors were from china but then again these are data from the week of November 30 to December 6 wherein the absolute number of tourists are very low at 3 000 visitors only aside from seeing data in the tabular form trip also supports the so we could check travel patterns of tourists using the map here   can choose the point of interest and period then click to see inflow or outflow of the visitors in this case let's select myeongdong again as our destination and check the movement patterns of domestic tourists here we try to answer the question where did domestic visitors come from to visit myeongdong in the whole month of October 2020. so we see that most visitors are from different districts around Seoul except one that you see under the one in the blue that is the gyeongji province which is still pretty near from Seoul maybe around 40 to 50 minutes by car so we can see that for the month of October most people came from nearby areas on the other hand let's check the outsole so where did domestic visitors go to after visiting myeongdong so here again lots of people majority of the visitors remained in the same city of Seoul and actually made that this district that myeongdong is in so 31.3 remain at the jungle district of Seoul here are some examples on how this solution has been used in Korea first Katie and the Korea tourism organization or the made an agreement to invigorate domestic tourism industry and for five years kit has analysed the trend of domestic and foreign travellers and has been integrating the results to its tourism policies the second case is analysis of local tourist spot for example there was a project to increase the number of tourists in hangman cave a tourist site in Korea using kit tourism analysis solution kit has identified routes to nearby tourist areas and reorganized bus routes that link the spots and here are some examples on how the solution has been used to analyse domestic tourism in Korea and this is a pre-existing report done by the using kit’s data and analysing the domestic tourism market amitotic 19. So here this is a representation for the period January 27 to November 15. overall we see a negative relationship between confirmed cases and the number of visitors so when new cases are high people are reluctant to travel around Korea has had two covet 19 waves so far although at the current time we are on our third wave unfortunately but aside from these times when the country experienced spikes in the covet cases the government was able to contain the spread of the virus relatively well and there have been two instances where we observed a positive year in your change in terms of the number of visitors throughout the period so one is week 17 that's April 27 to May 3 and the second one is week 39 September 28 to October 4. so for the week 17 this was the so-called golden week of Korea one of the biggest holidays in the country and the week 39 wherein it experienced a 13 percent uh year in year change this was the this was chuseok or the Korean thanksgiving day this is usually when families travel to their provinces or hometowns for the week for or the weekend at least so in both holidays Koreans would usually travel abroad but given the ongoing pandemic and travel restrictions people remained in the country and here we see visitor and expenditure trends after the outbreak overall of course on the left most we see the nationwide average for the period under study then we see data for all 17 administrative districts of Korea on average visitors and spending dropped 19 and 27 respectively and most impact on the number of visitors was felt by Seoul with a drop of 29 while the most impact in terms of expenditure was experienced by Incheon by 49 and all 17 administrative districts experienced contraction both in terms of visitors and expenditure but this experience was less severe in provincial areas so these are the seven provinces enclosed in the orange box next let's dive into the expenditure data to see how people spending patterns have changed ever since the covet 19 outbreak in the country this is a nationwide data again for the same period and the credit card data was used to extract consumption data all tourism businesses experienced negative growth except golf course and rent car businesses so golf course grew by 17 while rent car businesses grew by 62 which is pretty impressive but then travel agencies and duty-free shops are experiencing the sharpest decline so overall tourism-related industries in Korea were no exemptions and experiencing the negative effects brought by the pandemic so yeah with that   end my presentation for today and thank you so much for your kind attention thank you so much and Trevor for your excellent presentations it was really insightful to see what can be done with big data let me now go to the panel discussion and   have the great honour to welcome a very distinguished panel today uh let me introduce first to you the three panellists we have a first miss Sandra carvalho Sandra is the chief of tourism market intelligence and competitiveness at the world tourism organization since June 2018 before that she was the chief of communications and publications as well as deputy chief at unwrap with market trends competitiveness and trade in the tourism services department prior to joining the unto in 2003 Sandra worked for the Portuguese national tourist office in Lisbon Sandra has a degree in national relations by the Universidad technical agency and a postgraduate degree in marketing by the universe that completes the Madrid second Mr Mario hardy Mario is the coo of the pacific Asia travel association pata since November 2014 pata is a not-for-profit membership association that catalyses on responsible development of travel and tourism within the Asia pacific region Mario is the past chairman of the board of trustees of the pata foundation Mario has over 30 years of experience in specialized aviation businesses focusing on data analytics and technology coupled with several corporate leadership capacities and he currently serves on various advisory boards Mario has also received an honorary doctorate of letters from campillana university in 2016 for his philanthropic work in Cambodia and third Mr Ricky hoy Ricky has been the deputy director of the Macau government tourist office since 2018 he supervised the organizational planning and development department as well as a tourism product and event events department he joined in 1990 and served as head of the licensing division from April 2009 to march 2015 and then as head of the organizational planning and development department Ricky holds a bachelor of business administration degree in business information systems from the Macau university of science and technology so a very well wrong welcome to you all let me start with Sandra in the presentation that we have just seen by Trevor we heard that there are a lot of difference between traditional statistics and big data my question to you is how do you see these two come together and let's uh assume a government doesn't have enough money to really fully developing one of those what should they do first um aim for that traditional statistics or already start developing the big data over to you centred thank you very much Matthias good afternoon everyone and good morning depending on where you see us today um and thank you to Trevor and Juan t for the great presentations that they just shared um   would start by saying that one should never eliminate the priority of the other traditional statistics have a concept of reliability and comparability that are critical for policy and big data which has emerged in in recent years should be and should work as a complement um to that uh traditional statistics um  ’ll give you um an example from our side at the world tourism organization we work with governments around the world to improve their statistical capabilities but at the same time we work to make sure that they can leverage big data into either improving that traditional statistics in terms of time availability in terms of comparability as well but at the same time for example domestic tourism domestic tourism that has now been one of the priorities and probably will be in the year to come is one of the areas that traditional statistics needs to be improved because there's still huge gaps so working with big data can actually complement that information as we have seen um in the fantastic presentation from Korea as long as we define the methodology very clearly how do we identify a resident and a tourist within the big data how can we actually match the two to make sure that they're complement and   think there's also an important point in what you were mentioning is the holistic approach to destination management many of the data or either big data or statistics that we need might not be tourism specifically we were just hearing in the presentation by Trevor the issue of resources use those are data often that are also available in other sources so for tourism to work in a holistic approach it's key to really have the full picture of the impact that we want to know about tourism in a destination thank you very much Sandra and so let's assume um the government wants to build up a market intelligence system to basically capture these different um sources of data and intelligence uh in your opinion what does it take to build up such a market intelligence system and at the national level but also at the local level well   think the first one is putting it as a priority   think it's very important that either if you're a national government or a local government that measuring is one of your priorities if that doesn't happen from the start then it's not going to translate into actions the second one   would say is a cross-cutting approach to that market intelligence system or travel system as we have seen in the presentation from Korea which is you need to bring all the players together the public sector the private sector at national and local level but also the different administrations you need to bring the transport ministry together you need to bring finance you need to bring foreign affairs because tourism penetrates in each of these areas so a lot of the data that you actually need probably sometimes is already there you just need to identify it   would say the third point is that you define your KPI very strongly and very clearly if you don't know what you want to measure from the start then you have to implement such a system and the fourth point   would say is then go into identifying the available sources identifying the resources that you need not only the technical resources but human resources   think um in the beginning there was a comment that the tourism industry is probably still behind in in some of these areas compared to other sectors and   think we need to invest in in talent we need to invest in training in many destinations um there are a lack of human resources who are capable of managing and developing the systems and the last point   think it's very important is um to make sure that national and local level are coordinated so that there's no duplication of efforts and that the learnings can be used by everyone sometimes there are obviously indicators which you will have available at local level that you don't have of national and vice versa but it's very important that can be a system of coordination as Mr butler mentioned in the beginning for example you end up with your network of sustainable tourism observatories looks into the different pillars economic social and environmental of the impact of tourism and there are many examples of destinations where using big data to actually measure such impacts and the last point   would say is the importance of having actionable insights because you can have a lot of data you can have a lot of information but if you don't transform those into policy or into action then it's just investing in a system um  ’d like to share one of the examples of our observatories which is the Buenos Aires who's built a very good market intelligence system and for example they identified the failures that the comments from the users in terms of accommodation and most of the comments were very much in line with the need for refurbishment of hotels which led into the opening by the Buenos Aires government of a specific line of financing for hotels refurbishment so   think it's important that we don't miss the point of insights need to be used for a specific policy objective so with that   would um   would leave it here thank you Matthias thank you very much so let me now turn to Mario and uh just to let you know the audience can always ask questions please either raise your hand or put your question in the chat box and then   will ask questions to our panel Mario um in our forthcoming report and it is stated that it's important to establish an environment that incentivizes the private sector to work with the public and create a win-win scenario and   know it's a tricky um question on how to best do that but   would like to pick your brain and tell us a little bit more how these pops can happen and what are the possible risks involved in those pops sure thank you matt yes probably the best way to answer this question is by actually giving you an example of what happens when you don't so this is a real case uh story but you know   will keep the destination anonymous although   think some of you might actually guess which one it is so several years ago one destination was a victim of her their own success they were so good at promoting the destination that they actually ended up doubling their number of tourists at the destinations itself in a very short time space and they woke up one morning and the sewage was actually overflowing into the street electricity was cutting down all the time they ran out of water and they actually had aircraft parked in the ground with no rooms available for actually putting these tourists in because they're all sold out so the destination was literally sold out um what happened is the destination was really successful at developing a very good marketing campaign and promoting themselves and et cetera but never actually shared this plan with the other divisions of the government they never inform the people that are managing the infrastructure managing waste management managing the electricity energy and water consumption and all this of their plan that actually that the if should they be successful the population on the island if your account for the tourists would double and therefore able to manage uh the capacity during that period of time so that's what happened when actually one the private sector or the public sector goes in and do something without actually talking to the other relevant divisions and departments the partnership is critical and this could have easily happened also where the private sector would could have gone on and actually do a really good job at marketing themselves without necessarily involving the government so the situation is not unique either republic or private it happens in both ways so this is one example out of many where collaboration is absolutely necessary  ’ve also seen the opposite where uh the lack of success was the fact that actually there were no collaborations between private and public because one end was marketing something the other was marketing something under destination and ended up with conflicting messages into the marketplace where the traveller what they can find with this nation and end up going somewhere else um so the collaboration is actually critical and the collaboration is not only between public and private   would say also collaboration is also critical between government departments themselves as the example   gave you before where there was a lack of communication with other divisions of the department we at pata were invited a few years ago two years ago to do an assessment of developing tourism in a   would say practically virgin destination where the number of tourists at the destination on the island was only 899 tourists per year um it's a fantastic opportunity for someone to look at developing tourism from essentially from scratch from nothing and how you can actually develop sustainable sustainably over a period of time and result responsibly but in that assessment we had to do all the things   just talked about understanding what is the water consumptions and what are available on the island what is the energy consumption available on the island what is actually the situation in terms of waste management and what does this nation wants to be wants to be known for what type of tourists do you want how many can you accommodate on the island what is your maximum capacity what is the ideal capacity for the destination but this would only been possible by having conversations with all parts of the government as well as all the different sectors within the private sectors of the hospitality the uh transportations uh the tours and activities and developing sustainable products uh so    ’ve said it since the day   joined pata that you know it is critical that uh public and private partnership really work hand in hand in developing a destination responsibly and sustainably thank you very much Mario you just mentioned the environment and these negative externalities from tourism um so we also heard them that big data comes from the tourism sector itself but when it comes to those externalities how can we actually leverage big data to better measure those that that would be interesting to know Mario with the youth sure Sandra mentioned it a little bit before too that many of these data sets are actually already available within the governments they're just not available to tourists to tourism but they're available in other parts of the government uh the co2 emission for example the amount of waste being generated uh the energy consumptions of water consumption uh the economic impact the job impact also all of those needs to be actually taken account when you look at your tourism policies for the long term in your tourism development it's not only you know the arrivals and the spending data which are critical and you need to continue to be measured but you also need to include other data sets that are available within your governments they may not be available to your department at the moment and that's a question of you know sometimes just reaching out to other divisions of the governments or working to your ministry more closely and developing better relationships with other divisions of the government to develop a central data set that can be used and pull from other parts and we hear from Ricky later on to how Macau’s doing it and they have a really good system and how they actually aggregating data from other divisions of the government to make their strategy better moving forward thank you so with that let me turn to Ricky you have prepared a short presentation that um showcases um what you're currently doing with big data so the floor is yours for five ten minutes Ricky you're muted Ricky you're muted Ricky you have to unmute we can't help you hello yes yeah okay good morning and good afternoon everyone this is Ricky from the Macau government tourism office i'm very happy to be invited to the webinar and to talk about the big data and the tourism recovery   have just prepared a small presentation so we'll show you the presentation and then we'll come back for the discussion uh for those who are not very familiar with Macau probably when you [Music] when we talk about Macau the first thing you can think of maybe is the casino yes indeed Macau was a was somebody called Macau the oriental the Orlando Monte Carlo but actually we though we are a very small city but we are a tourism destination will many different kind of entertainment for example the world class hotels we are also inscribed on the Enesco heritage site since 2005 and in 2017 we come become a member of the Enesco creativity network we are the city of gastronomy member even though the big portion of the government income is still from the gaming site but yes so we will see the tourism industry is a very important economic period of Macau during the past month the epidemic yeah give a very severe hit to Macau but   think the mace government is doing quite a good job to fight the Korean 19 pandemic so far we have only 46 confirmed community cases and the last case happened on 25th of June that means we are almost more than five months we don't have any cabernets here in Macau when our city becomes safe we plan to launch some measure to help the recovery of the tourism sector one measure that   can share with you is what we call the Macau radical e-coupon platform of course the objective is to stimulate the spending on the tourism industry and to and to support the local economy we are offering this platform to the local shops free of charge and the shops they are free to give any discount in whatever format they think appropriate so far we have run the platform for more than six months and now we have already the 670 merchants on the platform and the discounted items are almost 2000 and the discount coupon downloaded by the tourist and the local people has more than 200 000 so why   mentioned this platform here what does it do with the back data   would say traditionally we will distribute the coupon in print format in paper coupon for example at the entry point at the hotel at the restaurant it says stretcher but now this time we use the e coupon format so what is the advantage of using the e coupon this this is the most advantage is we can easily collect information the data of what the result of the or of the discount cube one with the traditionally with the with the traditionally with the paper coupon it's very difficult to collect data of how the coupons are distributed how they are used but with this one platform we can at any time easily collect information and the situation of the coupons for example we can easily count how many coupons are downloaded by the tourists in what category they are they are they are they are in whatever they are and how they are used et cetera et cetera uh yes uh we are still running the platform we don't have uh we are now still in the data capturing stage uh we don't have uh much actual usage of big data of this from this platform yet but we certainly we know that this platform will help us to plan for the next stage of the strategy for example one objective of our strategy is prolong the leaning of stay of the tourists so in this from the from this preliminary result we collect we can say the download coupon in the accommodation category is about 40 is about 40 percent but the discount item we offer are just only 12 percent so with this kind of information we can adjust our measure in the next phase for example we can the government may subside more on the hotel on the hotel product so as to attract more tourists who can stay here in Macau for one more night and another item that   would like to share with you is how we use spectator to enhance the business travel experience when talking about this item   have to mention that since December 9 2019 the mace government already launched an open data platform this is a what we call a smart city project cooperate with the alibaba crown of mainland china in this platform many government builds they contribute data to this platform and these data are free to be used by the public of course this open data creates many values in different aspects but one point   would like to highlight is with the open data platform we it turns to make some new product or service it becomes possible one application that   would like to share with you is this smart trip planner this is also a cooperation of the mace government and the alibaba group uh the trip plan it applies to the air technologies and it uses the data in the open data platform that   just mentioned so that we can suggest an itinerary for the tourist and of course at the same time when we suggest an itinerary for the tourists is able to collect the user behaviour from the street planner and then we with this data that we with this feedback data is very good for us to have an in-depth analysis at the at later stage   just stumped several screens laptops from the trip planner so to share with you so that you can have a more concrete idea for how the treatment is doing this trip banner was launched two weeks ago is a very new system and sorry that we only have a chinese version now but the English version will be coming very soon so at the very beginning we will ask the user how many days they want to stay here in Macau and what is his or her interesting point for example she wants to he wants to visit the cultural sites or they want to have a relaxed trip to enjoy the local food here in Macau and then based on the interest of the users the trip planner we recommend we think this is the most ideal trip but of course the user can always do some customization of the trip and during the trip when they turn on the tree panel again we will always promote an interesting pure ice in neighbouring areas this could be a restaurant can be a museum or can be an exhibition houses when the user click on one location for example in for example a museum of course the trip planner will give them the some basic description of the museum like the operation hours some photos something like that because the trip panel is linked it's connected to the database so we can always have the latest news to the user for example the museum due to an emergency maintenance the museum may be closed today this kind of latest news will be sent to the user [Music] and again because the true planner is linked to the database we can even offer some real-time data to them to the user for example when the user moves from one location to the other we the treatment will recommend the bus route to him and because all the public prices here in Macau are already equipped with the GPS system so exactly we have the real time data of rear buses e so in this case we can also arise we can also advise the user the available time of the next pass and so that they can have a better planning of time and go to the bus stop on time   think this is the end of my presentation just to conclude sorry that we don't have much concrete cases of using big data to help them tourism recovery but just like the speakers in the previous section say we all believe big data will be a very good tools and they can give a very useful contribution to the future development of the tourism industry thank you thank you so much Ricky very interesting presentation and   think Macau is really at the forefront of this development let me just ask you two questions the first one is about data privacy because you said that you basically can follow these tourists around the city so of course this raises questions about data privacy so how does Macau ensure data privacy uh yes we do have our law to regulate data privacy in 2005 we the what we call the personal data protection law was came into enforcement in 2005. since Macau was a Portuguese colony this personal data protection law was originated from a from the European legislation system and   will say it has a very strict regulation on using the personal data and very strict regulator on the data piracy for example take back the trip plan when the user launched the we have to ask for their consent that we collect their personal data if they don't give the they don't give the consent we won't do any collection of data and even they do the consent we can collect the data we have to by the law by this regulation we have to take out all personal data for example when the user is using a website to run the we have to take out the IP address if he is using the mobile phone we have to take out the mobile number we have to take out the main address code so that which means we cannot collect any identification text from the data and this is   think this is a very uh how to say this is a very good protection of data piracy okay excellent another question that   have is about your collaboration with alibaba cloud and because   think other governments also would like to engage more with the private sector um so what has your experience been uh when working with the private sector uh what have been some of the challenges that you were facing uh-huh yes here Macau when we talk about cooperation with the product sector usually we will we will face two extreme cases one on the one hand for those integrated resource for example the sense growth for example to win because this kind of what we call the international enterprise usually they will have sufficient support to the to the government measure so uh the cooperation with this kind of big enterprise we the cooperation will be very smooth but on the other hand when dealing with the this will bring in quite a lot of   won't say problem but quite a lot of barriers to overcome for example when let's get back to the back data because we understand when talking about big data usually it all involves the technology right so here for this kind of for this kind of project of course the has to install extra equipment otherwise they won't be able to use any new technology and investment of course is one thing we have to consider and the second thing is the training we have to provide sufficient training to the shops employees so that they can know they know how to operate those kind of equipment and another very particular case here in Macau is many traditional shops are still owned and operated by some aged people these kind of people they used it to run the business in their own way and   would say they don't have very high intention of using technologies this is also another challenge that we are facing that's very interesting this question of inclusion also how to make sure that everybody can benefit from the intelligence that you'd generate through big data we have about 10 minutes left for uh questions so please feel free to um raise your hand or put the question in the in the chat box um otherwise   would like to go back to Sandra   think this question about you know inclusive usage of big data is an important one what's your view on that Sandra on the inclusiveness of big data well   think it comes to what   was mentioning before in terms of resources   think it's very important that there is increased collaboration at national level because you will have destinations which have the capability either financial or human to develop it and others who don't so   think there's an important role to be played by the national government to ensure that there's a national   would say more than big data   would say a truly measurement oriented policy that can either include big data or it can include traditional statistics   think and   always insist on this   think management of tourism because of the different impact it has on different levels is so cross-cutting that if you don't have an holistic national approach it's going to be very difficult but at the same time it's very good to see some of the destinations who are leading that can also help others and   think for that you need to have a strong public collaboration as it was mentioned and let me go to Mario just again about this collaboration with the private sector because also he um in we have approached the private sector and tried to get some data from them but we didn't find this color collaboration very straightforward because of course a lot of these uh data providers they for them it's their core business they're not always willing to easily share even a small part of that data so what is your advice to governments to approach the private sector and to actually start a collaboration with them Mario over to you sorry excuse me once one second is the internet one moment yes we can hear you okay good sorry i'm having issues with internet so   just switched to 4g um the yeah   can   can definitely understand what you're saying   was one of them before one of those companies who process data and who government approached to get access to freely to the information and the answer is yes if you have money because we're a commercial entity and therefore the data we aggregate   mean just to give you an idea to aggregate the data we were processing the annual cost operational cost of aggregating this information was in excess of 20 million dollars uh so you can imagine that actually it's we also as a business as a corporation we also have to recoup our own costs and obviously our shareholders expect to see some returns at the same at the end of the day however   believe there are actually ways to work with many of these uh private sector organizations um and maybe in different ways and collaborating many of them are also equally interested in uh finding alternative additional customers within our sectors um and in ways of doing partnership introductions uh and helping them to grow their business in a different way with uh with a limited access where the information is used for maybe internally and not distributed externally we at pata have formed some of these partnership with some organizations where we do have access to the information to help us guide us inform our members to make better decisions moving forward but we do not have the right to actually share that information the detail of it with the members because if they want to they can go and purchase it and do their own analysis so   think there's ways to collaborate you have to be creative in your approach and be flexible in the way you work with them but i'm sure Sandra’s got similar experience also   see her nodding and   know that her and   have had similar experience with private partners too so Sandra would like to add something or yeah no   think that's a very important point   think there's two big issues here um   think there's um you know the concept of big data for good   would say and there's been an interesting discussion in some destinations when the um the over tourism issue rose which is do public entities um have the right to at least have a minimum data with no cost because it is for public sector management um and there are actually destinations even thinking about regulating that so   think you know it's an interesting it's an interesting discussion um the other point is what Mario mentioned obviously making sure that that data is collected uh processed and intelligibly available it's a huge cost so um   think partnerships are the key but   think forum destinations as well um there's maybe an opportunity for bigger collaboration um maybe at a regional level maybe at uh you know national different demos coming together to reduce those costs because um unfortunately   think often the negotiations are very on a one-to-one basis um and if maybe you have a pool of destinations coming together maybe the conditions can be better as well so   think there's different ways to approach it and as Mario said as well you have different layers of information for example we're now partnering with several companies and we have a unwed recovery tracker tool in our website which is free access to everyone where you can have information for in terms of occupancy rates trends in hotel searches in hotel bookings in airline capacities but you have that at a regional or sub-regional level you don't have it at destination so   think there's different layers of information which can also be useful thank you very much Sandra we have one question that was put in a chat box um the question is do you see any difference of tourism intelligence adoption between established or majored tourism markets and emerging economies how policymakers and market players are ready for implementation of big data and tourism so   think the question is about do we see difference in terms of um the usage of big data across countries who would like to take that question yeah maybe Sandra or Mario sure   can   can start Sandra i'm sure can add later on um the there is a huge difference there's a difference in terms of the capability the skill set that are actually available in the respective destination management on in understanding how to interpret the information and how to actually use information but there's also a huge gap in terms of the finances the money available to have the right tools to be able to process that information in a way that actually helps make better decision um  ’ve seen both hands  ’ve seen destinations such as Macau with Ricky or Singapore Hong Kong who have got a very sophisticated platform  ’ve got data scientists working for the destination  ’ve got really fascinating tools as we've seen also with Korea to help to guide and make these decisions and they've been trained they've got right individuals they have the right tool sets to help them and  ’ve seen the completely opposite of this the other extreme where uh someone's got a three ten-year-old laptop trying to process something on a on an excel sheet and get data cards from the immigration office on sometime twice a year and have thousands and thousands to process manually and will go to it and then you receive the data uh a year later uh so you you've got the two extreme here in terms of the capabilities of the different destinations and   think the emerging destinations or the smaller ones or the one really needs some help at the moment to give them the proper tools the proper training to help them to elevate them to a better standard moving forward very good Sandra you would like to add something yeah thank you Matthias thank you Mario   think   would add two points one reinforcing what Mario was saying the need to support those less resource destinations and   think this is the fantastic platform to think about how in step maybe we can help those destinations in two ways one make it sustainable also and this comes to the human resources point and the technological point because you can develop fantastic systems with you know emerging destinations but they need to be able to sustain them in the future so we need to be able to train people to identify talent and that talent sometimes is very expensive and also tourism needs to be an attractive field to work in compared to others for data scientists and   think this is a very key point for us and the second one is also the opportunity to leverage country to country collaboration so for those countries which are more advanced as Mario mentioned Singapore or Macau or Korea to actually also think about collaboration and cooperation in technical assistance in this area   think often technical assistance has been implemented in many other areas and this is probably a new one that we need to think about as well so   think there's a huge opportunity to learn from each other and to support each other here thank you very much about two three minutes left are there any questions from the floor otherwise   will maybe ask one last question to the three panellists a very short one um since the three of you are at the pulse of the tourism sector and you've been um looking into a lot of data what's actually your outlook for the tourism sector for 2021 just in 30 seconds maybe  ’ll start with Sandra again that's the most challenging question of the last one hour and a half 30 seconds   think obviously the news of the vaccine has to be a game changer and   think we need to now see the implementation of the vaccination um   would say we still have at least another challenging year ahead and   think we need to be prepared for that but   think if you look back six months ago then we're more positive than we were that said   think the sector is still in very challenging moments it needs higher support to navigate until we're back into a level that was the pre pandemic level and from our side at unto we still see that we need at least two years and a half two to three years to actually be there and we need to support the sector as we go through um   think it's very important and we often reinforce that we need bigger cooperation between government in terms of travel restrictions because this is the biggest challenge we see when travel restrictions are addressed that the demand is there people want to travel but we need to achieve that and   think we cannot forget going through the vaccination that we need to implement the systems to manage the information on vaccinated travellers now because otherwise in a year time where a big part of the population might be already vaccinated the systems will not be in place so   think it's a moment to step up that international and regional collaboration thank you very much Sandra Ricky yes your outlook for next year when looking at 2021   think it will still be a very difficult year but we all should look at the bright side of it uh here in Macau   think we are a little lucky why   say that because mainland china is our major source market and we all know china they have a very good control of the [Music] academic situation there and next year though we all have to work hard and harder and but we all look very we are very optimistic that um more tourists for mainland china will come to Macau and   hope our tourism situation will have a big recovery in the next thank you thank you Ricky Mario  ’ll keep it short a very slow and gradual recovery but some glimpse of hope that things will get better but it will take time thank you very much thank you so much to all the panellists   think we had a very insightful and interesting discussion and that covered many topics within this big data and tourism area that brings you to the end of this webinar thanks so much for participating and just uh on one last point on um big data and tourism we going to all see one tutorial coming to many of our houses very soon namely this is what  'd like to present   do not want to bore you with a lengthy introduction of our company if you like my presentation   think mr. wolf gave such an interesting talk then you can simply contact me personally so then of course   also give you all the information about a company   would Bend line to focus on what Big Data and advanced analytics mean   do not want to go to all the technical details but  'll try to give you some examples because   think examples are important because they can convey messages and this is what   want to do   will give you examples for example how you can make a booking   gave you give you example of planning your trip   have a visionary example how to cancel trip and tourism infrastructure a tourism education path will be presented and then   give you some examples what we do in projects if companies are interested About us ok now briefly about us we came from big data and b.i   don't know how much knowledge you have in this field but we are classic services providers and we come into play if companies want an evaluation they have a data warehouse idea they want to carry out analyses and we're not talking about Excel analysis but rather professional analysis here we come in and whenever people want to deal with real-time scenarios in big data and machine learning that is   don't program my machine but my machine learns and these inputs in form of videos text files or CSV files and turns that into something useful so that is basically the message without going into further Customers detail and here are some company logos of our customers so we have a very broad scope of customers not only in the tourism industry but in industry in general Manufacturing and in trade so we have a Technology very broad scope but a very broad customer base now   would like to talk a little bit about the technology please don't feel overwhelmed by all the technical information but   have to give you some idea of what this presentation is about a new company you typically have booking and reservations erm systems human resource financial accounting and investment accounting systems this is the old data world that has been around for about 50 years you know these systems and most of these solutions produce some good or well useful evaluation but what is more important is the new world social media data have web tracking data and the Internet of Things that is cars mobile phone sensors RFID chips whatever is around and gathers data and these two worlds should be connected and this is Big Data what we do now what is big data about   have two terms here our logics data advanced analytics five years ago if people had asked me what does big data mean would have told him lots of data and the second thing   knew was they will not start you that is not data in the database but data earned for example like hotel ratings in regular text and what can you do with that so we're talking about unstructured data but about two weeks ago   was with one of my customers take America and for them ratings are most important things if customers write that ratings about this hotel they will no longer be booked by the booking entries whatever HR is a booking calm now if data is too unstructured too complex too Advanced Analytics short-lived or too large then it has to be structured now we don't only talk about big data but also about advanced analytics and   want to give you an example what that means everyone knows from press articles what the Tesla Model S and Tesla a Tesla car was involved in an accident with a truck what happened in this situation there was autonomous driving and autonomous driving has to be programmed now if you think of a human programmer he can no longer consider all the situations that are possible in traffic but with machine learning you show what the situation was you give data information that it was a white truck and the autonomous driving car didn't recognize it as such an persons died this was tragic but machine learning helps you avoid that in the future a machine learning involves hundreds and thousands of videos that were fed into the machine and this input was and turned into learning conclusions  'm exaggerating a little bit but with machine learning the situation of the accident have happened so machine learning and advanced analytics is our key to success because programmers human programmers cannot work as fast as a machine can learn today ten years ago we had the chess computer and if all the chess games that were ever played are fed into the computer the machine will be so intelligent they're not even a world champion could win against them and this is the message what you can do with that is you can make conclusions regarding customer behavior you can recognize patterns in customer behavior you can score a customer valuable customers less valuable customers and to give you another example if you analyze something today with 50 influencing factors you cannot simply analyze it with an excel sheet you need parametric analysis that independently produce clusters and knowledge another example that you might already know what happens if   put the six-pack of beer next to diapers how does customer behavior change the classic situation a woman sends her husband to buy diapers and if their six biggest next to the diapers he also buys beer so an advanced analytics works in a similar fashion and it's very important for sorting out data now this is a timeline from traditional business intelligence and traditional analysis we go to advanced analytics traditionally we which respectively analyzed situation that happened sales revenue number of bookings come it became more difficult when Diagnostics or diagnosis were involved what actually happened the OLAP analysis the data cubes was drill downs and other analysis or Excel table analysis in order to find out the causes and the situation but now it becomes more interesting in this block and   will give you some examples later on what will happen   make a forecast of what will happen just think of the tourism industry think about Turkey what happens after the presidential elections in Turkey who can actually predict that we can now forecast that there will be another 30% drop of bookings in Turkey but who can actually describe in specific terms a system can do that much more intelligently than people and becomes even more exciting when it's about influencing the situation what do   do so it will actually happen actively influencing situations so this customer at Starbucks will get a text message here's a mobile you get 10% on the next cappuccino and they feel like a cappuccino so they walk right in my kids would say okay yeah nothing special but what happens Starbucks locates you with your mobile you're in front of Starbucks if you walk twenty yards further you will not get a text message but you will get the message if you're in front of the shop so the customer has to be actively located and has to receive the offer just in time and this is really exciting you might know it from the internet you buy something at Amazon and Amazon gives you the message other customers also bought this and this is a similar system now what would   like to show you Application Cases now regarding application cases this is an overview of what's happening what happens in the tourism industry people no longer booked package deals they want more personalized offers collaborative consumption is a new trend consumers form groups and by certain offers in greater quantity to get a discount so you can complain because your price will drop but on the other hand your process costs will also drop and you will probably then specialize on your and here are my four examples all taken from real life and then travel planning is something like a vision it doesn't exist yet but it will exist in the future and it would also help me   think the example that  've brought you   was so clearly indicating that we need to change here here's one example   don't know whether you know quick sit and   give you an example this morning in Bachmann south of Germany   wanted to come to Berlin   booked two weeks ago   went to the homepage of the German railway company and bought a ticket then   took a plane to Berlin and   needed a taxi to come here from the airport and tonight   need to go to the airport and then   go to Munich from here by plane which means   have a lot of transfers if you go to quick-set this program this software will organize the whole trip for you they compare all the different transport modes rail flight car taxi and even shared rides and then it will indicate the best trip for you and you can even set your preferred price if you want to go to Berlin for just 27 euros there are certain for you perhaps you just don't care about how much it costs and then they might suggest you take the Concorde so this is a great system Data Sources the underlying data comes from different sources for example from D transport operators as   said you can travel as you like you can walk you control my bus train plane and so on and then all the different Big Data modules are combined this program looks at all the different data sources scans them all in real time and will tell you within seconds what is the ideal trip for you   think the benefits are obvious for anybody who travels a lot you will save a lot of time scanning through data scanning through information and it will really simplify my journey and then perhaps in the future   will also be able to cover some of the trips by car sharing which means there will be more transport modes and here at the bottom   would also have that vision that when   buy my ticket there is some type of holistic system meaning   just have to buy one ticket that covers the entire trip and whenever people check me on the way they just Holistic System have to take a box or whatever but   just have one ticket this takes me to my vision let's say whenever   travel there are a thousand different options that   could use this morning   looked at Papua New Guinea and things like that now let's say   want to book a trip for four weeks then   might spend several months in order to book a trip and in order to make a selection from all the things that are on offer of course   can go for an all-inclusive package but as soon as   want different entertainment types for example like theater cinema and so on it would be ideal for me if there was such a program or software like quick-set that would combine it all for me and   would just have to enter   would like to take three hiking trips   want to do this or that and in this system scans all the different offerings Yelp and so on it also takes into account recommendations for restaurants and others then perhaps   go to TripAdvisor and look for a couple of tourist highlights in a number of cities   also follow the recommendations for highlights there might be actress for example and these were just the standards what that software would also do they would scan the America forum would read through these millions of sources and extract a perfect itinerary for me imagine there were to be such a system   think it would be a major simplification in something all of us dream of and that let's say the system proposes seven different types of trips to me it would save me an awful lot of time and effort of course it's not always good for the machine to do all the work for you but the question is what are the benefits and what is it that a machine Benefits can do better than i okay   don't think   have to explain all of this in depth again these are just examples how such a trip could be compiled and again the idea is that   can save a lot of money a lot of nerves and   end up with a better trip and on top of that a trip that is within my budget another spy speed is available pass your topic last year   traveled to a southern region in Germany and   had looked for a hotel and what happened is all of a sudden   get a telephone call and a lady tells me you have booked a double room but just for one person is that correct and   said no this is not correct   might have been on your website but   never made a booking then the lady on the phone said okay it's our hotel but unfortunately   cannot cancel it so please write an email to book income so that they tell us to cancel it and that's what   did   had to write an email to booking dot de and said there my cancellation request now look at the time code and then you see what happens booking come within two minutes sends me a cancellation and it's a lovely letter very friendly and book income tells me your trip has been cancelled now you might think how is that possible are there just hundreds of people waiting for my request for cancellation and do then these people people type the cancellation letters of course it's not like that booking calm handles hundreds of different languages and so you can imagine that it's all automated based on machine learning the system generates an automatic reply and this of course helps booking handle its request let's assume they have a million bookings per year then they have a five percent or 1 percent cancellation quota every cancellation would need them custom five minutes and the hourly costs are ten Tourist Trails URIs and you also see how much money can be saved in this case eighty five million per year and here's another topic   wanted to address in Germany and   think also in other countries there are a lot of tourist trails they are normally big science nice pictures and to me   would like to think that there could be digital science interactive science and here   just tried to figure out how what they could look like so as   said let's say there is a tourist trail and there is some information and education on how bread is being made then one thing you can do and this goes back to Starbucks you could imagine that somebody looks at such a sign and if you read such a sign you can scan a QR code and then you get a discount on bread or coffee somewhere you see the QR code here you could also use that QR code to show videos for example that give you more information on what this whole trail is all about   actually wanted to show you a video right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] would give us okay so Bob Fisk in London okay sorry it was a bit long but the idea is that with the help of digital technology a QR code you can offer additional content this is a video that was made by the chamber of Baker's they find it hard to recruit new Baker's and that's why they made this video in any case it can also be used here and it can help you bring more life Travel Warnings to these informational offers so   gave you a number of examples where analytics can be applied and another example would be travel warnings let's say your employer sends you on a business trip then of course your employer also has a certain duty of care visibly you and here is a new tool developer a teaser and it gives you real-time travel warnings imagine like in 2015 there's an earthquake there was this earthquake in Nepal let's say such a thing happens and you're on the way to the airport to fly to Nepal then you can reward in real-time and then you can decide not to go quite apart from the fact what this means for your travel insurance and so on so all of these are examples that we could come up with in a travel industry and   think these are all topics and issues that could be interesting for you we also discussed another example today   mean everybody says our world is changing and keeps on changing many people think that digitization is something that gives rise to concerns or even fear but we believe if we harness it in the right way it offers a lot of new opportunities for our industry and   just gave you a numbers number of examples much more can be done what we have done but in our company is that we collect big data and advanced analytics cases we have set up what we call a solution library it is structured according to a subject catalog and here you see what the different data sources are and the companies that use this data sometimes people say to us our big data that is something for a Siemens or for sa p the large players and we tell them no it's not true there are so many companies with 100 employees or just 50 employees that could work on this topic and that what perhaps find new opportunities to grow these are some examples from the tourism What can you do sector many many things that could be changed and improved so what could you do if there is if you have an interest in this we'd be happy to pay you a visit at your company and we come up with a plan we will speak to the executives and introduce them to business intelligence business analytics advanced analytics and we all really take some time to explain what all of this is about then we will try to establish what the overall goals of your company are just so that we get a sense of what is possible many of you or many people in your company might already have their own ideas and then what we do is we provide some of these solutions that we already have at hand we also scan the industry try to learn more about your competitors and also learn from them and then as a next step we try to find out what we need to translate this into reality and to find out which type of data you need because otherwise we'll just be wishful thinking after all we also need to have access to all of this data last week we spoke to a logistics company and they said they preferred the itinerary or route planner of Google compared to their own and we said yes why not there could be an API so that you can connect to Google's travel planner it's not a problem the next question is all about technology which technologies do you want to use would that be cloud based technology or is it important to you to keep your data in your company what were you find important is one pivotal message of course you can start working on this and very low costs twice   would just by using a cloud and you don't even have to buy anything you just need the right service provider now to conclude   would like to thank you for your attention for being here and   hope   could share with you some part of our philosophy and also some information about the opportunities that exists hotel and tourism association and on behalf of CH ta and our

president for government and development for MasterCard Advisors she leads the team over in MasterCard that's responsible for business development with governments and the public centre entities to promote inclusive economic growth she joined MasterCard in 2012 and as part of the global prepaid product team and she started her career as a consultant working with Fortune 500 companies to improve Salesforce effectiveness and she got an MBA from Princeton and an MBA from Columbia Business School of course MasterCard is a strategic partner so  'm going to go ahead and transfer over the reins of our webinar to Antonia let me know what you've got it great that is wonderful thank you very much for the kind and you got an Adriana and good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to our webinar on tourism insight driven by big data as Adriana stated my name is Antonia   work at MasterCard and  'm very grateful to Adriana and the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association for allowing me to present some of our latest insights and tourism solutions to you this morning  'd like to start with a quick disclaimer though for those of you who are not familiar with MasterCard contrary to popular perception we are not a credit card issuer we are a technology network we connect twenty thousand banks with 50 million retailers over 2 billion card holders what that means is that we process about 50 billion transactions every year and that is the data that we can leverage in an aggregate and anonymized form to help governments to help retailers hotels cell banks understand global trends and consumer behaviours better and that brings us to the topic of the day tourism so why is tourism important to us   thought  'm having trouble here   know that  'm preaching to the choir Challenges in Tourism here but let me just say it tourism is one of the most important economic sectors globally it is growing faster than other sectors it is creating good quality jobs it's creating an infrastructure investment cross-border spent and driving the inclusive economic growth that MasterCard hopes to achieve in the markets that we serve in the Caribbean alone of course tourism as a sector contributed fifty seven billion dollars u.s. and 2017 and employed some two and a half million people but there are also challenges facing the sector global competition is increasing tourism is shifting towards emerging economies from developed markets growing faster in emerging economies and people are going to more exotic locations if you will consumers are turning to dozens of sites and social media and different digital sources in order to plan their trips and their travel making it more difficult to understand their behaviors and more difficult to reach them and the quote unquote phenomenon of over tourism is in some cases degrading citizens quality of life and challenging sustainability and really growing the existing model of tourism into into question so in response to these challenges we have MasterCard we took a step back and we looked at our data sets to see how we can help and we realize that our data on commercial activity and then consumer purchases can be combined with other third-party data of tourist behaviors so as to create a single platform that provides insights into the behaviors into the sentiments and into the spending behaviors of consumers across the entire travel journey and in turn of course help optimize marketing investments by governments and by companies so as to attract the most valuable tourists let's look at one indication of how tours and behavior has changed this is quite a busy slide but as   like to tell the story 20 years ago when my mother was planning the family summer vacation she would go to one single travel agent she would book flights she was hotels choose tour operators maybe a get a rental car as well everything through one single point of information right today when  'm planning summer vacation   start searching three months in advance   am inspired by what   read on TripAdvisor   see what my friend tweet an Instagram about   go and check for the best prices   then might even stop by a travel agent and inform myself better and there's this incredible funnel 38 different travel sites on average is what the US consumer at least goes to before actually starting out on their journey and this creates an enormous amount of data that is harder to digest and harder to action and that really is at the heart of our solution so new insights New Insights and also new approaches in terms of marketing   needed to effectively compete in in this sector on the one hand digital tools will only the use of digital tools will only continue to accelerate there's more and more data touch points and more and more data also generated by travelers actions right especially among the younger generations for example shocking number 84 percent of Millennials are likely to plan a trip based on someone else's vacation photos or social media updates   am secondly the tourism organisations that we speak to for example here just two examples one in Thailand one in Singapore the overarching message that we hear really is a need for better insights into which tourists are coming how do they behave and then how can our tourism boards that are targeted and better attract the quote unquote most attractive tourists the higher spending higher quality tourists that drive real value to the economy and real job growth so that is the challenge that we set ourselves a short summary of what we have to offer as you will as   mentioned earlier we have a lot of data that data is not personally identifiable information by MasterCard has no view of your name of your demographics of where you live what MasterCard sees is where a card number is used to make a specific purchase for a specific amount at a specific date and time that data is therefore limited by all means however it is global and by aggregating it in an anonymized fashion and actually starts to reveal global trends in travel we felt that data in itself was not enough we've set ourselves the target of creating a 360-degree view of the full travel Full Travel Lifecycle lifecycle so what we do is we merged in information on searching so  'm starting to search for my summer vacation and   go to Google into other websites and   start putting in different Caribbean destinations where are the people who are searching that way located what is the funnel between searching and then checking out pricing of Airlines and hotels to actually booking the booking data we receive from the big gess we blend in behavior by which we mean our spend data so once   am in my vacation spot where am i spending what am i spending on right and then lastly but   think most importantly this notion of sharing what am i tweeting and instagramming about while  'm on vacation and when   come back home are my social media posts positive neutral or negative what specifically do   tweet about in a specific location what are the attractions that   find most relevant what this data does together is to cover the full travel lifecycle both before and after the trip for a deeper understanding of the patterns that tourists are showing in order to then be able to action this data so as to better inform marketing campaigns so it's better to inform investment decisions etc so in the next few slides   just wanted to cover some of the use cases before we actually jump into the portal all right so for example these are screenshots of the platform that we'll be looking at in just a minute a key question that we Most Profitable Visitor also get asked is who's actually the most profitable visitor where's my most profit they're coming from and also what kind of services what kind of categories do these visitors spend on you can imagine there are big differences in spend behaviors for example both Russians and Chinese tourists spend a lot of money when they go to the Mediterranean Russians tend to spend very little on accommodation theory being that they probably rent private villas frankly or own private villas Chinese predominantly spend on retail right there very high-end shopping Germans  'm German myself so   can say this armoire tight-fisted we spend a lot on rental cars frankly we don't spend a lot on restaurants or accommodations so you can start to understand not just who is the most valuable customer coming to your destination in terms of spend but you can also think about what type of behaviors do these tours that show how could that inform my marketing messages in different markets we also look at the Individual Transactions individual transactions that different destinations offer so for example here we happen to be looking at Dubai Dubai has a range of attractions from cultural to of course shopping to restaurants etc and we can see that travelers from different origin countries from the UAE itself from the UK from the US make use of different offers right sunbathing is far more exciting from somebody coming from the UK or the US and it is somebody coming from the UAE itself which actually makes sense we can also look at where on maps essentially tours from different origins are congregating what are they interested in which venues do they go to is there actually a pattern in terms of their movement across this destination and finally we can look at competitors so for example if   am Dubai   might want to compare myself to Singapore   want to understand how its tourism mix is different from Singapore how the growth is different from Singapore how   compare with Singapore on different attractions be they you know active lifestyle gastronomic cultural etc so  'm bathing for example is better than Dubai than it is in Singapore as this chart shows that's a fact and we can also look at the sentiment of tourists a sort of a perception index we call it how much of social media is actually positive versus negative so generally how happy are tourists from different origin markets with my destination so in short hope is that this deeper understanding by leveraging big data from multiple sources this deeper understanding of different visitors can help destinations that can help retailers grow their tourism revenue whether that's from making more targeted marketing decisions that allow you to target marketing spend reach the right origin countries and also construct the right marketing message to reach each individual origin market or it's about making smarter investments understanding where tourists go and what they which attractions they really value the most all of this based on timely accurate data aggregated and anonymized fully in line with global data usage practices updated monthly and with a modular pricing schedule that should fit most budgets and then employing on this large array of data the artificial intelligence and the natural language search capabilities that allow us to parse things like search behaviors like Hotel evaluations and like social media sentiment one case Case Study study that   wanted to share is from a city a European city which essentially wanted to attract more shoppers during the holiday season in particular the Christmas holiday season their initial hypothesis was that tourists coming from nearby markets would actually be the most attractive shoppers we looked at more than 2 million mentions from social media networks to really interrogate what tourists are doing from different origin markets and conducted analysis that show that in fact long range travelers are the best target market for the city in terms of increasing holiday shopping and so the tourism agency of the city put together its holiday marketing campaign based on these insights and revealed actually that they increased their their marketing activities getting to 70 million hits just for that one holiday season by having a more targeted message focused on a more targeted segment so this is just as one example that's a lot of talking a lot of slides what   wanted to try to do now is to actually show you the platform a demo if you will to sort Demo of bring it to life for you a little bit in this case we are looking at data that we extracted for New York City   must mention that New York City is not a current customer of MasterCard for this data we chose the city because of the interesting demographics and of course New York's place as a tourism destination so we build this demo off of New York City data so if we look at the overview first and Overview foremost what we want to show is first how many people are actually booking 40 million passengers for a specific time period we are looking in this case at the year of 2017 from January 1st to December 31st we could interrogate specific time intervals as well tourists saw 40 million bookings stay on average of nine days and as you might imagine most people coming to New York are actually domestic travelers from the United States second most relevant from the UK followed by the Dominican Republic in terms of the actual spend by tourists however they spend on average 621 dollars on their MasterCard when they're in New York but as we can see over on the right here the highest spend is actually coming from China not surprisingly really we will look at those two dynamics in a little bit more detail soon domestically the highest spenders coming from the Los Angeles region mostly because these are people coming from longer periods of time and spending more money Fairfield County and Connecticut where   live these are day trippers that might come to New York to see a show there'll be a lot of them right but they will not spend as much because they don't typically stay overnight and so on and so forth in terms of social media insight we essentially try to grade overall sentiment of tourists in terms of their appreciation of New York City as a whole we call this the global tourist perception index and we try to index it it would be a score of a hundred if all of the social media shares we're positive what we do is we essentially using natural language search we score social media activity as positive neutral or negative and we arrive at this composite score in this case 81 which compared to other destinations actually is not bad and we also look at the product balance by product we mean different types of attractions culture versus nightlife versus restaurants versus active activities New York is not very well balanced full balance would be a hot score of a hundred right certainly restaurants and cultural activities are a lot more popular and a lot more positively perceived and for exact for example nature right or active lifestyle with the exception of Central Park of course then we start to drill down into this funnel so if we start Search Behavior with people search behavior for example we can compare to country search behaviors that's just for the fun of it let's try to look at the UK's behavior versus Germans short search behavior when it comes to searching for their trip to New York on average across all destinations searches are up 30% over the previous year when searching consumers are putting in a stage eration of on average of 11 days we'll see in a second whether that's actually borne out by their booking behavior and they start searching 2 to 3 months in advance if   look at the UK then their searches are up by just 5% year-over-year they tend to stay for nine days and they plan well ahead of time we also look at when in this time period so looking at the seasonality of when people are searching mostly in the tail end of the year we also look at the actual weekday on which they search so Sunday seems to be the most popular day to start thinking about your trip to New York Germans are up a little bit more 7% year-over-year and they tend to stand for longer periods of time as the search behavior shows Germans seem to be interested in the Christmas shopping period they also tend to do they're searching during the weekdays   guess they don't work as hard as the Brits spending some time at work searching for their next vacation their next then we can look at pricing for example we look at slides but a capacity we also look at hotel prices just as an example we look at data from TripAdvisor and other sources we rank hotels between three four and five-star hotels to arrive at an average right of pricing for hotels this was a good indication for a destination to understand whether its hotel prices are competitive with other locations whether it's hotel prices are increasing rapidly in a period that might be worrisome and might discourage some tourists etc and then Booking Behavior let's look at bookings so this again is data that we are sourcing from the G DSS let's look at how the UK and Germany now book rather than search so again   will select these two countries to drill down on so on average total passenger volume 14 million we talked about that before nine days of stay and they actually purchase tickets 38 days in advance the UK stays for ten days with approaches sixty days in advance and doesn't show very much seasonality in terms of booking what we do see is that they do tend to booked on Tuesdays predominantly so maybe if you have digital media campaigns understanding which day of the week is most prominently used by tourists from different destinations could it help inform your marketing strategy Germans there's about half as many Germans as Brits arriving they tend to stay a little bit longer booked 73 days in advance and similarly as the Brits Tuesdays and Wednesdays to be big booking days so the notion of this tool is simply that you can break down different origin markets to query in a little bit more detail what their search behaviors look like and what their actual booking behaviors look like now next   want to actually look at spend so starting with international spend by origin spend is fairly seasonal New York does see a lot of traffic of International Spend retail shoppers right prior to the Christmas holiday season top ten countries based on spend our China UK Brazil big spenders Australia etc we can look at that in a little bit more detail now to see actually how different nationalities or origins rather are spending and what they're spending on so if   look at China for example see that the average spend per card holders $1,500 their spend year-over-year is down that might have something to do with Forex fluctuations some care what they tend to spend on is a lot of retail that orange bar there that 50% is very high not very much on accommodations they seem to be frugal a little bit of miscellaneous which would include anything from business services to things like jewelry to things like to transportation etc the United Kingdom spends a lot on accommodation there's probably some folks here that traveled not just for leisure but for business tend to spend more on hotels London is a great shopping destination in itself they don't do as much shopping in New York as the Chinese do Brazilians again more shopping trends and a great increase year-over-year as well and so on and so forth so you can have a closer look really at how different origins are behaving in order to inform marketing in order to inform your retailer strategy in order to inform what kind of tourism advertising you offer once tourists are actually on the ground the same data of course is available for domestic artemy after refresh real quick   think   lost my internet connection for domestic tours coming from the United States you're also able to query in detail how the top origin locations from the United Hotel Satisfaction States spend in New York City what else and then the behavior of it   know we're almost out of time but   didn't want to mention this so for example one thing we can look at his hotel satisfaction   find that quite interesting so if you wanted to know for how happy are people coming from the UK compared to people coming from Brazil in terms of their hotel satisfaction we can look at their global hotel satisfaction index bars indicate essentially that the Brits overall are happier than the Brazilians and that is true across three stars four stars and five star hotels that's pretty steady across the year and we can also look at specific departments of a hotel our people mentioning for example that reception is is not doing its job that the rooms aren't clean that the staff is not friendly so potentially if you're working with your hotels in your destination you can have a better understanding of where improvements might be made and specifically with give them specific traveler segments now we can also go to social media perceptions Social Media Perception based on the country just to make it a little bit more interesting let's pick two countries let's say Canadians who are very close by versus the frenched who   would assume always have higher standards than others that turns out to be a little bit true Canadians generally are more happy than the French about their New York destination product balance in terms of how well balanced is the tourism offering of New York City they're both pretty equal and they both like the weather that's the climactic over here pretty much the same in terms of the number of mentions this gives you an indication of mentions by week there's always a spike when the tourist is in New York City they do tend to mention it on social media when they are there on September 11th which make sense in terms of individual products for example the French value the arts and Individual Products culture of New York more the Canadians seem to be into their food and cuisine a little bit more nightlife the French appreciate a little bit more individual attractions looks like the French go to Brooklyn more and the Canadians and also the Brooklyn Bridge these are just indications we typically work closely with our customers to identify what exactly are the tourist attractions that are most near and dear to that destination so we can put that into our natural language search filters for social media and for screen scraping online to really focus on the attractions that a given destination wants to promote so these are just indicators that our developers chose based on their own knowledge of New York City we might want to make them very different and include you know whether it's specific venues or like Madison Square Garden for example should be on here in my view or spec tivity specific activities like concerts etc we also have a look for example at the different products in more detail so we can look at arts versus food and active cuisine we can filter this by nationality we can filter this by gender we estimate whether somebody is a male or a female based on their social media behavior so we can drill down on some of these scores and try to get a more granular sense of the different perceptions and sentiments really of different segments and then we can look at the map based on let's say buy product first so if   look at a map of New York City if my data loads give me just a minute sorry it's a little bit slow so here's New York  'm gonna try to zoom in a little bit on Manhattan itself let's see where family activities are taking place no surprise there's some around Central Park in Midtown there's the museums in Midtown people mentioning JFK   guess in Brooklyn when they come in but if   then look nightlife more specifically that's a little bit more spread out there's different specific clubs and venues for example Williamsburg in Brooklyn the some of the clubs over on the far west side on the lower west side etc so you can get a sense really of how spread out tourism activity is the same is true of course Barre where nationalities tend to hang out when they mention different locations on tweets if   look for example at where the Canadians what the Canadians talk about when they are in New York it's pretty localized around Manhattan Americans of course themselves are far more spread out they'll go to New Jersey they'll go up Harlem and into Brooklyn etc credit far more readily they tend to roam wider so this might also give some indications of how tourism overflow strategies are working if the intent is to drive some tourists outside of Manhattan for example more into places like Brooklyn or into Staten Island or into Queens and into Harlem then tracking on social media what different tourist groups are actually tweeting and social media instagramming about will give you an indication of how well your tourism over for those strategies are actually working last point and   know we're Competitors almost out of time adrionna what   find interesting about the platform is also allows you to look at competitors we decided for this demo just to look at London and Dubai as possible competitors to New York so if   look at just New York and London   can see you know different perceptions and different satisfaction scores with these two destinations and   can go down and look at different what is interesting the different origins for example interestingly about 60% of tourists to New York City are coming from the United States whereas London only has about 35 percent of its tourists coming from other areas of the United Kingdom right very different behaviors there there's more Americans going to London if you will as a mix of total tourism and Brits coming to New York City as a mix of total tourism in terms of product offering they're actually pretty equal seems like New York has a very slight lead in terms of food and cuisine seems like London has a slight lead in terms of active lifestyle we look at gender distributions and also on age distributions they're quite similar hotel satisfaction seems to be higher in New York which is a good thing because New York hotel prices are also far higher we can see here in London so the quality better be higher and it's a good thing that the perception at least matches the pricing behaviors in this case and then lastly just as an overview we also of course offer this data for Download Data you to download in Excel format we also offer you download you know PDF reports etc to share more broadly with your organization but that is a very quick spin   hope it made some sense through the actual demo platform and of course we could show it in far more detail if there's interest but   just wanted to give you a flavor of what this tool looks like and open it up for for questions okay wonderful thank you so much all right so let's see we have a few little questions here the first one How often is this platform updated is how often is this platform updated as far as the data very good question so the social media updated data is basically updated almost on a daily basis that's almost a continuous flow our spend data however is only updated on a monthly basis with a with a specific spend lag built in so to be clear MasterCard has to protect the data of its card holders of its retailers of its hotels etc so that is why we only share it in aggregate form that is also why we share it with a certain time lag so that no one can look at data and try to superimpose however certain hotel chain is performing right so the data frequency of update the platform in itself is refreshed every month but the different data sets come at different frequency so if that makes any sense from social media daily to booking on a weekly basis to our spend data on a monthly basis well the question they came about is how is the sentiment How is the sentiment portion in social media portion in social media this is a sentiment overall of a particular destination correct if it doesn't serve as kind of a benchmark as to what you perceive on your own social or how can you utilize that particular data effectively so explain how we do this what we look for is going for social media posts we identify excuse me where the owner is from let's say   have a Twitter account that   believe is it's German we can parse the information and see is this person talking about New York City in general is this person talking about the Statue of Liberty specifically we can then parse that information and infer whether it is positive neutral or negative social media  've gotten a question one about how good our natural language search is on picking up on snarkiness and irony not that good frankly we're working on it and we are seeing improvement so if somebody said others places awful and means that ironically we would probably rate that as negative that is true so what we do is we aggregate across all of the different social media that we parse and we categorize it based on location so if someone talking about New York City in general about the Statute of Liberty in particular and then we aggregate a score of satisfaction which is essentially saying if they were all positive it would be a hundred if they were all negative it would be zero and the you know the average on where you fall in that score gives you an indication of satisfaction with that particular destination which you can then compare to other cities or within a city to other attractions right Brooklyn Bridge versus Statue of Liberty let's say okay another question   have here is looking Can we compare from destination to destination at it from as a tool to benchmark correct so we can we can compare from destination destination to destination right say Antigone compare it to Dominican Republic for example but then can we go and compare on a more macro level and compare on a regional basis say the Caribbean and house performance versus Asia so where are absolutely English is that possible that's a great question so there is one limitation that data has which is if you reduce if you try to go too granular you end up not having enough data points to be statistically significant right so if   wanted to look at a specific block in New York City right   would not have enough spend behaviors certainly not booking data not enough social media data in order to infer anything of meaning for that block so we need a certain level of size if you will and a certain level of activity in order to be statistically significant in terms of going macro though disguise related limit   mean theoretically we could create a global view of tourism sentiment right it just increases the data flows in the data volumes makes it a little bit more costly of course because we're aggregating more information so for example booking information   think most people on this call probably know this because that price right the GDS is monetized they're anonymous booking information so if   wanted to buy all of the booking data for all of the world it would be more expensive than buying it just let's say for Barbados so that is something to keep in mind there's a slight cost differential but from a technical perspective the limitation really is at the granular level not so much at the macro level or yes answer the questions yes you can compare the Caribbean versus let's say the Mediterranean absolutely How to identify new niches would this be a useful tool to carve out a new niche when it comes to marketing your hotel product yeah so that if that is really what we are working hardest on so one is to make sure that we are understanding that the current hypothesis of Tours is correct lots of destinations do a fantastic job really trying to understand their tourists engaging surveys using reports etc what we're trying to do is to get the next level of understanding not just volumes of tourists but also the the quality if you will and what they care about right and to do that in a way that aggregates information in a way you don't have to be a data scientist so digested so if you are interested in identifying new niches   think there's two ways of doing it one is looking at are there specific tourist segments that we have overlooked right either specific origin countries that we should actually be spending a lot more time and energy on because it turns out that they're quite high quality tourists that's one thing other things in terms of actual attractions and destinations let's say  'm South Africa right let's say  'm responsible for marketing South Africa as a destination and  've been making a lot of investment in the garden tour right the garden trail that goes through the wineries in South South Africa but it turns out that most of my best tourists end up going to Kruger game park well then maybe   should take a step back and say wait you know  'm not putting my investment in the right places or if it turns out that tourists are that the best tourists especially are going to a destination that really wasn't even on my radar Mimi   should start creating a niche sort of marketing campaign around a specific set of tourists that enjoy a specific type of destination or location okay so it's also a great way to maybe select who How to select thirdparty vendors potential third-party vendors could be yes so we start working with some absolutely so we've been working also with some destination marketing organizations looking at you know in detail these tourists behaviors and then as MasterCard of course we also have we have a global brand right  'm probably seeing the price with campaigns so then engaging more broadly with marketing efforts to say alright if we have a very specific corridor that we want to address if MasterCard is also interested in how can we help amplify through specific offers specific experiential offers that we create on our priceless platform so as to drive you know the right kind of tourists quote-unquote the right kind of tours to the right kind of destinations tight kind of retailers the right kind of events etc so  'm gonna make this up now this is pure hypothetical let's say that South Africa realize that you know very attractive to tourists coming in from the Gulf countries are really interested in and in a sort of restaurant rich experience of Trahan iceberg they're less interested in the wildlife and they're less interested in the wine tour they want to have a great restaurant experience in Johannesburg we could actually work with them and see okay what priceless offers do we have and can we create with leading restaurants of Johannesburg to package at the priceless offers right to feed back into the specific market of the Gulf countries so it's turning these insights which by themselves mean nothing into something that is actually actionable right mm-hmm okay we have a question from CEO Dana Country of origin data she's asking currently at the moment what are the current trees with the what country's data do you have do you have anything on South America good questions about country of origin like for the origin so the way that we assemble this data is we do it on a case-by-case basis and so to be clear we would work and sit with with a customer and really understand the scope of their destination the top attractions that they want to query what they know about their current tourism's behaviors then we actually pull in all of the different origin countries all right and examine who are the big travelers the big searchers the big spenders right and that is what we then would load up into the platform to create that custom data set if you will now MasterCard sees customer data from across the world the only limitation of course is if somebody's exclusively used using cash in a country where there is very little banking activity then we do not see those behaviors  'll give you a good example   was looking at the country of Uganda Uganda n--'s do of course travel abroad but they have so few card holders and so few tourists abroad then as an origin economy   cannot say much about them it's really not statistically significant right first it's a country like a Brazil or versus a country like Mexico where of course you know the usage of electronic payments especially when it comes to cross-border travel is very well-established all righty so and yes Peru she continued as a species is particularly interested in Peru for example but that would be   could look at the specifics of Peru right   needed a tronic we know   could   mean we would basically run a quick data run and see just what exactly the data looks like and we compare that then to some external studies to make sure it's bust etc my assumption definitely would be that we would be able to say something about tourists from Peru absolutely beautiful okay another Download question we have here is can the information be downloaded off of the platform or is it just viewable from a good graph form online good question so what you can download is you know sort of a shiny glossy PDF if you want to have a report print out maybe share it around that's fine but we can also arrange for it to be downloaded in a pretty simple Excel format or table format couple comma separated values wonderful alrighty let's see another question we have here how many origin companies can you view on this and in the pressroom analysis is at 1-205-271-2980 with a lot of How to get started information all the time and there's possibly a fear of paralysis when confronted in so much data variable as it is what would be a good way to get started say you have the problem you see this very useful dashboard what what are the different first steps that's very interesting question because it really it really goes to the heart of what we're trying to do you know when we talk to our customers it's all about you know there's stacks and stacks of reports and surveys and you know online digital output etc there's just so much to absorb so our hope was actually trying to put something together in a way that easier to digest and easier to action right the way that folks typically look at this information first is to test their prevailing hypothesis right most people in this field have a very good understanding of who their top tourists are they're very interested in looking to see who may are the commercial behaviors the same as the passenger behaviors so checking to see hey are the people that look for me the same as the ones that book to me and famous ones that spend a lot with me right the second point is then usually saying okay help me look at how   compare right if  'm the island of Ibiza in the Mediterranean how do   compare to my your car next door right both in terms of who   am attracting how fast   am growing what kinds of attractions   have right then looking again were more internally a little bit more navel-gazing are the attractions that   think are the most relevant actually the most relevant are tourists as happy as   think that they should be   had a great insight when we ran similar data on Sydney Sydney hotels are awful apparently they have terrible reviews and that's a real actionable insight right for somebody responsible for a total Association of Sydney to start to look into right then over time as you get more familiar with this information one thing is you look at specific events   have another data set that looks at a European destination right after brakes it because the big interest of course is so the pound just dropped 25 percent how is this changing the flows of tourists into this destination right what is the impact of events what does the future hold for me given that the world just changed right that's another common query so looking at historical behaviors if you will and the impact of specific events and then really taking a step back and trying to understand how does how should this inform my longer-term tourism strategy right if   see what  'm doing or people are liking and not liking if   see what my competitors doing and what they're liking your not liking right right should   be looking at building out different types of attractions should   be partnering with different marketing partners to get my such as better right and start to inform those kind of longer-term decisions if you will the implications are are huge a great it's very very wide spending we Wrap up actually have one of your team members on on the webinar mr. John when you let me see if   can open it up so that he can John are you there yes good morning can you hear me good morning Don yeah thank you then thank you very much great presentation great thank you to CH ta and the members for being on the call   just wanted to answer two of the questions and work back to Antonio in regards to the Caribbean on regards to transactionality in almost 98% of the Caribbean were saying that they every every credit card transaction the coast were issues so in regards to cash very aligned with what Antonia was referring but for that tip a peace of mind regards what we can see and regarding cross-border data within the market we are when her okay okay with that Assaf right now many of you are already you know working with with math speaker and tourism solutions and in the case of padule the same we have been working with them and the question is yes we can provide that of data to do at this point in the market okay so   just want to clarify those two points thank you thank you very much John for jumping in and as always your market knowledge is incredible very helpful thank you wonderful well we got two for one here this is great okay so Antonia thank you so much for for your time and   just want to thank you for thank you for this great opportunity it's a real pleasure and thank you everyone especially those of you that George rather early in the morning thank you very much for your time Growing up in Bali 30 years ago, there was magic everywhere. We experienced the most amazing nature here. The rivers were alive. Nature was thriving and humming with energy. And it is those memories and those experiences that make me passionate, that make me work on environmental solutions. We've been challenging the status quo. There's this common belief that environmental solutions are expensive, time consuming, and complicated, and our team has been working on measuring and monitoring resource consumption to somewhat challenge the tourism industry, to be their friends but to also hold a mirror up against their face and to show them that we can all drastically improve. Environmental management is a team effort. It takes everyone to participate. And to get a team to work together, you need to build trust. And to build trust, you need accurate information. You need data and you need storytelling, the beauty of it. We've been collecting data and working on properties to show them that it doesn't need to be complicated, it doesn't take a long time, it's very affordable, and return on investments comes very fast. Bali's been in a constant tourism development boom since  've been a child. The last decade's been really extreme. We're now at, in 2019, we're at over 100,000 rooms. That's hotel rooms. We now have over 5,000 hotels in Bali. And on top of that, we have thousands of restaurants, beach clubs, homestays, amusement parks, and 730 Balinese villages. So there are seven hotels for every Balinese village on this island. The majority of this development is in the south, as we all know, and everyone is competing for the same resources. Everyone needs water, everyone needs energy, everyone needs a place to put their waste, everyone needs our biodiversity, and everyone needs materials. There's a strain on this island that is ongoing and coming to a certain tipping point. Energy growth - 10% on average every year. We are in a freshwater crisis, and we simply consume more water than we have. In fact, we are in a 13% deficit, and our rivers and water bodies are going dry. And beautiful waste - we have eight landfills like this in Bali. And there are thousands of trucks going to these landfills every day, the major problem being that no one separates their materials and it turns into waste. Materials can, in fact, be re-integrated into the economy, but waste can only get dumped, and we can't work fast enough: the trucks keep coming, and coming, and coming. So what's the good news in all of this? The good news is that we've been working on solutions. We've spent the last five years as a team, with my two partners, Maître Fischer and Wayans Lim. We've been working on showcase properties to challenge the status quo and to show the tourism industry that they can, in fact, cut their resource consumption in half, and that it doesn't have to come at a huge cost. Take this luxury resort for example. Just focusing on energy, they were using classic distance heaters for their villa pools. We changed those to heat pumps. Heat pumps provide air conditioning and heating at the same time. We insulated the piping, we insulated the balancing tanks to reduce heat losses, we combined pool pumps with fountain pumps, and we asked simple questions like "Does a pump really need six hours to clean a pool?" No, it doesn't. So why isn't it running four? We changed the Freon in the air conditioners to coolant, we upgraded their electricity connection, and then we installed some solar PV on the driveway. The entire investment paid off within under one year. And then the second year, the hotel saved over $100,000 on their electricity costs. This is a huge success, and that money could be reinvested into other solutions: in villages or in other properties. But there's so much value to be found in these properties; there's so much that we can do. Take this beach club for example - focusing on water. Savings in water are extremely hard to find. But what we do is we install sub metering stations. We use a simple tool that you can get in any hardware store. It's called a water meter. And we install it in all kinds of places, and then we accurately monitor the water consumption, and we can pinpoint where the water is going, who's using it - the restaurant? Is it going to the bars? Is it in the pool? - And we start to see patterns, and we can see how much water this property is consuming with the people that are flowing through it. We establish a baseline, and then we start to implement savings strategies. At this beach club, we reduced the amount of water needed for every flush. We installed aerators on the taps - those are water-saving devices. We fixed some small leaks that no one ever found because they didn't have the right methods. We even built a recycling loop for water to recycle used toilet water back into the gardens and reuse it for watering. And since 2018, this water park has saved over 45 million litres of water. That is enough drinking water for 60,000 people for an entire year. That's one property. And they save money doing this: 70,000 dollars a year. And the investment paid off in seven months. With this water park, we've been working together for nearly three years now. And we've been really driving energy and water and waste to landfill solutions; we've been doing biodiversity management. But just to talk about waste, we've reduced waste to landfill at this property by 78%. And we're producing 13 tonnes of compost on site now every single month. How did we do this? By making separation extremely easy, by setting up prep stations on the kitchen's counters, by putting coloured bins and buckets for organics, by adding posters, communications, doing talks, some policy design, making everyone understand why - why, why, why we're doing this - and every day, accurately measuring how much waste is going to landfill. So again, we establish a baseline, we know how much is going to the landfill, and then we start to improve, and then we start to report on that. We start to tell the teams, and we start to celebrate the success. A 78% reduction waste to landfill is over 256 tonnes - it's one property. Across the 25 properties that we've worked on, together with the [inaudible], we are in the thousands of tonnes of waste that is not going to the landfill. And this is all possible by separation at source. That's all that we need to focus on. It is the major, major point - to separate organics and non-organics so that the industry can do their job. As soon as you mix it, it's impossible to manage. We've been working on solutions, and ultimately, what we've been focusing on is to create showcases, showcases for the tourism industry, and showcases for everyone to understand, showcases that teach us that we can cut our resource consumption in half. And we would like to ask the hotel association to make a pledge - it's by 2025 - to cut their resource consumption in half.  'd love to work together with them.  'd love to inspire them to do this. And we would love to inspire the tourism industry in Indonesia that it's going to be a continuing trend to use their resources and to use their enterprise to inspire change and to empower the local communities to be the leaders of change.   mean it's a suppressor to be here and actually   mean what  'm going to present is let's say it's a little different from previous presentations in the sense that   am more in in the research environment so what we are doing is just to test some of the ideas that you have been discussing now so we want to see if actually this question of big data is or not useful to unbilled some of the of the questions about mobility in in europe and while we can say about tourism in particular with this we discussed on the field of information so as it was saying this is a world that has been done in a de Fisk that is in in Majorca and actually we then we are also suffering this this issues that you were talking about overcrowding and overpopulation of trees and so on sometimes   mean actually one of the of the questions that bring me to this to these questions was the feeling of locals with the residents the factory was an overcrowding in the in the island no   mean singlet actually the mobility in the in Majorca is very limited and divorcee later also Ibiza and Formentera know so it's very small pieces of land and then you have a huge amount of trees and a lot of mobility inside because apart from let's say to visit the cities you also have the beaches that are all over the island so many tourists rent cars and move all over around and of course this sometimes creates great concrete with the with the residents that have to take these roads for this one life no just to show you a little   mean kind of motivation of why we started in here   mean most of the of the information and here it has come out several times into this is obtained a be a service ok so this is just a copy of service that   found on internet about how to this but the important thing is that this is usually something that has some pros and some contrasts no so some of the process some questions that has been already mentioned so for instance you can ask people so what do you think and of course you cannot say that   mean online you can   mean you can do service on by the Faunus as the people from Karachi   was doing but online with big data you can to get this information easily let's say no because the bit data sources and   will focus on one of them later are not prepared for this   prepare for other issues and   can kind of lateral way a question the 2ds more to the satisfaction can appear in this deformation we can also a correct biases because you can interview the people that that you want so you can select by age by gender by economical label and all the coldest creases to have a kind of unbiased sample of the population and of course you can know as   was discussing before so you can ask these people as much things as you want because you can have a very well control sample of the other population which are the contrast well   mean the person from the representative from Croatia for the crash Observatory as said before something like they did an interview of the 1000 people and on the phone and discussed is around 10000 euros we did in a previous European project another survey about mobility in Barcelona and actually this was also about 1000 valid interviews in this case mean that means a very strict and biased policy to get information of mobility and the cost was ten times more so it is an idea of the cost of these surveys especially the ones that have to do with mobility because you have to ask count of things about which kind of transportation you take and when you do these and all these questions so they are very expensive and the other question is the difficult update so preparing the survey in Barcelona took us almost a year between the selection the people from the census doing the interviews and finally a processing the data it's a very slow process so you have to   mean crisis in in the case of Mallorca   know that the regional government had has it on all the time so essentially everyone did you appear in the airport you may have someone that tries to interview you what is your satisfaction without this destination so this is a something that takes out of time a lot of resources and then there is the question of what you can say about this with big data and also what we try to do in this case is because we were worried about the mobility at the Continental level okay so and in this case it's very hard to access any source of the data that gives you the full picture of Europe because thing that   mean we have when we were crossing Barcelona we also working with mobile phone records and mobile phones are very good are very detailed but typically they are concentrated in very small areas because a country by country the companies are different and the information that you get is very localized typically so very detailed but very localized the only one that we found that could be used in the continental level with it open okay because that's the important thing was Twitter and say why it's the important thing well just because of course you have facebook you have Instagram all of those are also at the Continental level but it has the bad side that the data is Express private well private it's privately owned they say and it's not sure openly in the case of Twitter by definition and also by the philosophy of the - of the tool all the information that is produced is share openly ok so this give us some kind of less a of a hint of that you can really access information all over the already continent but of course there are differences and this map shows the weather they are now so this is a map of the mastery so we are talking about provinces regions Landers will act everything in German is a little below London should be the nest level it's not true so essentially in this case the color represents the fraction of people that is using geo locally geo-located tweets so of course we are talking about the order or there something of the order of 1% or even a little less okay and the question is that actually as you can see there is a huge division between Germany and East and the rest of the of the countries unless this is usually something that tells you that actually there is a difference of the perception about privacy so they because they uses other ones   have to actually activate this this question and you ask every time that you are going to do a twit if you really want to be here localize ok so let's say for the people to do this what has to happen is that they have to agree and they have to have a perception that they don't care about these this kind of issues so or at least to share the data and also and of course they in this countries in the East in this block especially they have had a very bad experience in the past with this question so the procession of privacy is a much more contingent issue now so but okay   mean once you know that you know that there are differences originally and you correct by that you could say okay   observe here so many people traveling from   don't know from Hamburg to Palma and since there are some so much fraction of the population in Hamburg that to its relocated this means that our flow of people has to be rescale to came back to the numbers of course this the scale factor is very different and this is what you see in every area of Europe okay so once you have had that into account you can do the nest the next step and is this question which is the comparison between something that has been measuring in the surveys and the data that you are obtaining okay so what to visiting in here is to accumulate the flows at the country level okay and   think that the name that you have in here is the destination the final destination of the country of the flow and what we're comparing is the number of trips the messer in this case by a millions in the service at the level of aerostat and the number of try of trips that we are serving with twitter as you can see   mean of course well first of all this is a log plot a so   don't get the scale by the dispersion is much smaller this is the relative error okay and the question here is that as you see there is a cloud and this is the Iona so this will be the perfect match and the points are not so far away so that means that just looking at the attitudes and the flows that we wrestle with that under scaling with the information about the penetration at origin we are able more or less to see something that gets close to the to the final flows Messer with aerostat which is a very different procedure because it takes it from service ok so then the rest actually we should go in the direction okay in the nest we did the same but this in this case we will compare in the nights Messer let's say the Uniting hotels and insist these kind of establishments in the different dualistic areas and the flows that we were observing and in this case of course there is a difference a mismatch that is given by the fact that actually the bookies are here these are the twits flows so what happens is that we are overestimating the values okay and this oval estimation is also related to the fact that some of these nights are not spent in total so essentially this these bookings are only considering hotels but of course we know that there are some other things like our B&B is home away and although other industry that is also there producing more   mean given the say hosting to these people that is over here overestimating okay so once we have that and we have certain companies that the things is going well so the next the next question is to get some further information on this no so here you have the all the all the European areas and then the number of visitors that they are receiving according to these to these sort of measurements this is kind of very recent so   would really like to reanalyze it but just to tell you that at least in Spain we are doing more is okay as you will see later because actually this is the school site also with what we get in service so specially Catalonia is a region that typically gets a larger number of tourism and then the islands and undersea   come behind no just to show you how these look like   mean you can also measure flow the flows country by country and then you get this this kind of a map flow charts and these kind of things but then most more important that this this ones are more a little more quantitative so in this case what we are looking is whoops and this one is the different regions of Spain and the different countries of origin of these of these two lists so as you can see you can actually do a kind of diagram of Instagram of what is the main origin of the visitors and that we here we are not talking about the vistas   mean of course  'm putting this at the level of country because of convenience otherwise this could be a big mess but we can say also within these countries where they are coming from okay so because for instance in in Majorca when   have been talking to the 2ds to the authorities the local authorities about these and the ones that are related to statistics typically they tell you yes we know by survey that so many of the visitors are German so many are British and so on so on but of course the part of your mission is well just German is a big country so we're only in Germany you know so because maybe you want to target   don't know new campaigns of publicity or things like that you may need to know that because it's better that you focus on the lander that you are missing for instance oh okay so this this is the kind of results that you can obtain with these tools this was another example just to show you that actually were not only   mean of course   am in Majorca so we will focus on the Balearic Islands but this one is the same dome for a Tuscany okay so yeah once you have the access when you have the tools it's very easy to extrapolate this to the different parts of Europe with the advantage that you are doing it in a relatively you know homogeneous way no so this will give you a bill   mean this is the sorry this here you have the summer versus winter issue that also came out in a Sunday discussion before the scanning actor doesn't suffer that so much as you in Croatia or we in the valley a big islands because in the case of the valley reckons these two bars between red and blue that are summertime winter are also a factor two three mini most wait times okay so then they step in and   finish with this is to look inside the area what you are interested and see how these people is moving because of what   was telling you know so you can really estimate the flows and this is the island of Majorca the other one is murica oops let's see in this one okay so the big one is my orchid the small one is menorca and you can see in this case that's German people traveling inside because you can separate also the mobility by nationality no and this means also that you could also look at locals residents   don't have the map but   also have a map and the difference is with a different tourists and the different to this from different location so this is the same for British people in in German in in Majorca and there are some differences but not in this big picture so actually you should to see the difference you have to focus a little a little further and you see that there is a different areas of concentration of the two type of tourism in the in the islands and this is what you will see in this map so finally for instance this is another one another example this is a if it's an informant area and these green lines have the mobility of Italian tourists okay so most of them are essentially going to visa which is this one they visit a little the other side of the island and then of course they go to formentera you Selena in a day trip this is the typical the typical thing but with this kind of tools you could also measure a little the global picture and the global flow so okay so in with this we   finished   mean this is a very preliminary work because actually let's say when we discuss about showing the results we are still cooking them so we already still in the oven but well   already the preliminary results seems very interesting and quite good no so and   am trying to   mean this   hope that you have convinced that actor this big data provides some useful information about to this intelligence that can be used even when we talk about public data okay   mean   have to look at the how the mobile phone data is and of course it's much better so this will give you an idea that actually you can go and deeper with mobile phone data when you look at a single destination because the question there is that in that that the information will be limited to a certain area not to the full Europe but at the level European level you can even go with this public information the question that this is a   mean of course it has some value for to dismiss oh and especially for businesses they say to know which is the origin of the people and maybe to know something about the satisfaction or not even though that's much harder because you had to get into semantic analysis but it's very useful or it should be very useful for public managers which is the ones that   have to like princess in the in our Islands they want to have a are in charge of the transportation system also in charge of the medical and health issues and the ones that have to provide water and an attention to these people that is over the territory in the summer and then of course it's better if you know where they are or they maybe know so that that to be surprised by these questions and well   mean these results allowed to plan the demands and on services and on transportation that you may have and to take also where you can have concentrations of people and of course this this also quantified the impact that you may have in the Ummah in the environment like for instance just before coming here there was a discussion about the fact that in the summer in Majorca we went over the limits on pollution and then when they tell you well the origin of this is probably cars maybe the rental car should be electrical well yes or no but who knows   mean the question is where was this limits of pollution going   mean where was the concentration of pollution are these produced by locals this is it produced by any combination of tourists or only by to this so the question is you want to bring one of these methods like recess imposing electric cars in in renting well it can be a good idea but of course you have to make sure that actually this is the impact was produced by tourism by locals Welcome to Total Cast with your hosts Alexander Mocking and Jason Riley, where humanity steps into the future and source data defines the path. kelp Tiberius niacin we're not   know we look cold in here  ’m not sure it is cold or we're just so we took some supplements jacked up on those purples yeah and   don't know what they did like opened up the uh amount of oxygen flowing through us right now  ’m just like whoa yeah so we're a little jacked here  ’m really jacked up speaking of being jacked up yeah the touring industry that nice it needs to be its jacked up right now someone needs to fix that so recently what we've seen is that uh there's been a decline in revenue the tourism industry of like 100 What was that 100 billion? Yeah, 100 billion dollars. 100 billion dollars   know it's probably some, you know, very liberal, not in a political sense, but you know it's probably just like a high estimate, right? And then how many jobs? 39 million? Yeah, it was, uh, millions of jobs. Yeah, millions of jobs because of, like, covet, right? Tourism is all about interaction with people and cultures, right, and so they need to find a way to, you know, prop it up. It's a mess right now, and so it's like,How do we know it's a mess right now? No, it's a mess; it's a total mess. How are peoples habits changing and so when the tourism industry is like well how are people's habits changing right so they've been going through and they've been using uh you know large data sets big data to run analyses for business intelligence to figure out well where are people headed what do they want to do now that is a function of safe practices but allows them to give their you know their function of travel and experience where it needs to be right especially in this time so a couple of the examples that were talked about in this article where they were looking at ecotourism right so backpackers right you know or people that you know ride the bus to like go around and check out different countries things of that nature how do you how do you accommodate those people in the growth in that sector of people wanting to be outside do things a little bit more uh rugged right am   used to yeah and then being a part of nature and being a part of nature how does how does tourism move itself towards those sort of functions practices and services so they can benefit those people that are in the eco-tourism Ecotourism sector yeah and when you when you look at  ’m looking at the article right now when you look at it you can uh one of the big things that it's talking about is having a home away from home yeah so where it's cleaned and it's safe you know and   know airbnb has respond to that in a really good way um you know and people are even willing to pay a little bit more as long as it's a safe environment that they can be in yeah and let's think about a very specific um uh socio-economic group people that ski and snowboard yeah what you find is that all the people are flocking to their lodge homes those wealthier people right   got to get out of the city area and   just want to hang in an isolated area yeah oh and   get a ski to boot you know what   mean yeah it's a win for me you know   spent five thousand dollars on my pass but at least  ’m isolated from covet you know but that's what you're finding is that people are trying to get to those areas and if you look at what airbnb has done people want those rural getaways right like  ’m going to go hang out and you're in the middle of the woods by myself yes you know cell phones aren't allowed or   want to rent an airstream up here in taos yes   want to look at the stars and  ’m not bothered you know and that makes people feel good and so there's a change in that dynamic it's not like   want to go to the hotel or   want to check out the city it's like well now if  ’m not going to cities and  ’m spreading myself out how can data especially big data tell us about what these habits of people are doing and what they prefer now that life circumstances have actually changed yeah because Big Data uh big data is going to help them be able to decide exactly what consumers are looking for and it's more than the article talks about it is because all they were using um the internet for was for social media campaigns you know marketing that was about it yeah you know it's like oh okay they go to our website we retarget them with ads hopefully they'll click on it and then you know hotels.com is hitting you up maybe the guy books it yeah exactly so now being able to actually take the data and then understand oh this person did go to tulum and they did stay in an eco uh friendly hotel well maybe we you know then then the cool part about this is you're going to see marriott hilton's all the big wigs yeah you know they're going to turn around and say well maybe we should make our hotels more eco-friendly yeah or we need to start making more decisions on big data because you're seeing that now with uh when you go to a hotel they're asking you if you would like to you know have your sheets changed and everything like put this thing on the door if you actually want them changed right yeah exactly and what's uh what's interesting about this entire thing  ’m trying to collect my thoughts because they're all over the place is that the data itself is observational it's completely reactive so they're reacting to the industry yes so human beings already reacted to covid and then they're being reactive to them reacting to kofi Yeah, but   mean, when you look at the tourist industry, it's like, What do we do? You know, okay, we have a virus. Like, some of the hotels went and were more responsive and understood that people want to have a safe   mean, you still have business, but it's not just hotels. What about the people around the hotels or around resorts that make their money from Taurus? Yes, they got creamed, just absolutely destroyed, yeah, all the employees, and then that ability to be able to be safe with your employees with COVID because you don't want to give it to the guests? No, you don't, but you know, cruise ships are probably the worst cruise ships. Cruise ships are tough, so cruise ships have always been a nightmare. Yeah, you know, for a lot of different outbreaks, you know, they're like the og, the cruise ships are going to destroy the world. Yeah, we're getting some weird disease that's going to happen on a cruise ship. Why is my leg growing a lung that doesn't look right? Oh,   was on Carnival. Proactive Information, uh, no, but the gist of it is that they've taken this reactionary data, and what would have been more beneficial in terms of their big data analysis is if they actually got proactive information from the people. Yes, what are your habits? What are your behaviours? What are you planning to do now that you have COVID? What are your fears about it? And then it's like, How is that affecting your travel plans? Yeah, and you know, restaurants talk about that too. How they're changing, you know, so you need, like, a bigger area, a bigger state, you have to space the tables apart, maybe put people in booths. Make sure you have air flow waiting outside. Eating outside is insane. Are you ready? What difference does it make for Kovid? if  ’m sitting outside of the building eating in the cold with some sort of propane burner yeah keeping me warm or me sitting inside with the tables and have them spread out what difference is that you actually this is funny because   was so like   was looking in New York and they had these patios and they have plastic yeah so you took you were you were inside that was a bigger area you've made it a smaller and you've confined the airflow and you've confined the airflow but the worst part is what is the propane doing to me yeah it's worse than getting uh it's just burning off in there you know what   mean  ’m like,  ’m inhaling whatever byproduct comes from you having COVID.   think   had it back in March.   don't know, but um, well, why don't we just tell the world about my whole process? Don't we? Yeah, no, but   mean, every million yeah, but   mean, you have a 99.98 percent chance to survive this flu, so stop sticking people in tents. You know,   just don't understand that.   don't get it. It's illogical.   understand. Wheres the Data the mask   understand the six   mean   mean flues are way down the regular flu but where's the data that tents work better yeah exactly there you go what we see is this reactionary world to you know the service industry to tourism right you know and so when they start looking at the data they should be like crap that actually is not it's not doing nothing   mean how who are these politicians to make these decisions without looking at data they're not looking at any data no you know so if that's a good point politicians are followers right so when you start looking at you know hopefully you know some they try to be leaders but they have to listen to the public right they're voted into power so they're essentially a follower you know they're a sounding board so if they're using data which comes from the people yes and that's telling him how to do things proactively that's going to make a massive difference in how we make these decisions rather than making them on a hunch or saying that we should be intense because that's a different you know coven's not as you know it's not going to attack us in our tent eating space rather than us eating indoors right which is just an indoor outdoor scenario yeah exactly yeah that's that that part has not made sense to me yeah so if we want to really look to you know towards what people's behaviors are and what data and health says the tourism industry can combine all those things together in data sets and if they really want to enhance their data sets they can buy proactive data right and they can survey people ecotourists any type of person that wants any sort of experience can be found on turtle yes and you can ask those people to share that data to your company you know you compensate them for it but you're gonna have even greater compensational benefits from finding those tourisms Yeah, and then, knowing you know,   mean, just imagine if you could know exactly what these people that say they want to go on a trip in the next six months mean, and then slowly, as it gets into those six months, how much money have you saved, how much you're planning to spend, and how many people What do you want to do? Yeah, exactly. Holy crap, you have all the information; there's no more imagination, right? You're just getting hammered with the truth, and you're like, wow, this is great. Maybe you in the tourism industry find a new sort of niche because how many ads do we accidentally click on? Oh, that shows a tent all the time. So now you're getting so, oh, okay, oh,   know they're going; they looked up flight information and they're wanting to go to Malaysia. Oh, perfect, you know, and then next thing you know, they accidentally click on this hotel or they didn't even leave. That's working, and now we're marketing. Look at us. We're clicking on stuff about like Cebu in the Philippines, and then we're getting ads for like islands in the Philippines.   mean, well, we're looking at it from a business perspective, yeah, but they're hammering us with tourists, but they're handling the tourists, yeah, exactly. It's just so funny how it's just backwards. You know, advertising is so reactive. Yes, even the whole world of big data right now is so reactive. Let's take the proactive approach. We're reactive to climate change, we're reactive to politics, we're reactive to everyone. We're constantly in a world of putting out fires, fighting, and flight.  ’m so jacked up we need to start being proactive about projects we need to be proactive with the data from proactive people so how can they be proactive with turtle easy you go to turtle you click on get started and as a buyer right you can choose you're like oh let's look at what data is available for tourism what are people's behaviours and preferences oh wait a minute can   combine some of these pieces of data sure you can let's make a bespoke data set just for hilton okay just for tulum uh mexico right and let's do that and then   can go specifically get data from ecotourists or people that have those preferences Sell Your Data whatever that might be and then if someone wants to sell their data and help humanity how could they do that ah it's the same process so instead of signing up as a buyer on the terminal marketplace right let's start waving around because   feel like this is this is adding to the whole thing you can go on to turtle.com and you can click on get started and sign up as a seller and then you can choose those preferences of things that you want to put your data and time and work into and then get compensated for for sharing that information only the things that you think are good to you and we'll also come in and suggest things that you should be looking at right that may be you know higher value or something that you know maybe you know something that you'd be interested in it's better than an ad because we're trying to say are you interested in getting paid for sharing about this it's not are you interested in looking at something so you can pay others you know what   mean but  ’m weird  ’m worried about my privacy if   sign up you don't have to worry about your privacy we take all the best standards that you could possibly do in terms of encryption and pci standards from a financial standpoint and if you look up pci it's how they store credit cards properly We keep all that stuff completely anonymous, completely locked down.

What's your data worth? as   mentioned above in this slide   will focus on user-generated content data in tourism research one of the important sign user generated accounts in the data is only textual data including travel reviews and blocks the owner review data in tourism research generally originated from different social media platforms such as TripAdvisor yup Expedia CGA and so on a mountain TripAdvisor is the most and largest a favored review platform it was the most popular used in theory studies generally a review include four basic components like the linguistic features semantic features centimeter features and the review information linguistic feature means the month of the world in the review is a review easy of understanding up to date information is relevance a semantic feature means Wars and topics in the review centimeter feature means the emotions reflect from the revealed is it positive review or negative review   gave you an example here this review is about health engage search from the linguistic feature to see this review have few sentences and is English easy to understand and is relevant to this attraction from the semantic feature to see this review tell about the design of this church how it is look like it is a major attraction in Helsinki from the centimeter feature so see this review include positive and negative feelings the positive feelings sentence like we love the outside of this church the negative feelings could be reflected from we went inside but were not impressed in this review we can also know some reviewer information such as a nationality and publishing date for block data Twitter and Sina Weibo was two primary sources in tourism research currently so from the research topic to see many tribal review studies adopted online data in research of curious attitudes toward tourist products especially to make sure tourists the satisfaction from the review target to see most of Paris studies focused are hotels restaurants and the destination attractions in this way Hotel reviews were popular adopted for evaluating and improving the award of mass of a hotel restaurant reviews was a tourism satisfaction judgements the initial attraction reviews could help to identify this initiative use and improve destination management for blocked asia many studies based on travel stories and theresa feelings to figure out the tourism recommendation and choices tourist as an image toward a destination now we know what topics can be done with only textual data but what analytic techniques are used for only textual data generally there are two steps for analyze only textual data step one is data collection process researchers need to define what data they are going to collect and from where for example  'm going to research Phyllis destination image in Chinese social media so   may chose Chinese online travel review platforms and then using data crawling software to collect the data from social media platforms the second step is data mining which includes two sub steps they'd have pre-processing and pension discovery handle final step is to match the analyze results with your research purpose in data pre-processing different techniques were adapted for different research purpose and the popular operation are data cleaning tool ization word scheming and part of speech tagging data cleaning is to detect and remove inaccurate and useless information from the only textual data such as misspelling words stop wars and law of frequency Wars and of tequilas ation is to break up the travel related travel travel related attacks rotate into words phrases or other meaningful elements through this process the information related keywords can be selected from massive sentences what scheming means to identify the war shows and regard all wars with the same laws as when talkin here   gave an example of this wars consult consulting can be regard as consult and part of speech tagging refer to label each word in a sentence with post-hoc such as an own objective and the world patent discoveries and other important stage of textual data mining the arm of this stage is to explore interesting information is a textual textual data the most frequently used method wor LD a lantern directed collocation centimeter analyze statistical analyze clustering and categorization text summarization and dependency modeling LD is a topic model for identifying the abstract topics in textual data centimeter analyze is to identify the tourist attitudes towards a curious products services or destinations testicle analyze is the most basic technical for analyzing textual data such as describe analyzed test correlation correspondence analyze clustering and casualisation means to group a set of similar objects in one group and this group the objects are given with others curved objects from my point of view this quite this is quite similar as count annales texture summarization is to automatically produce a brief summary of a single or multiple documents a brief summary is a key information from the original text dependency modeling is to capture the relationship between the textual data and tourism factors such as hotel performance restaurant performance or travel behavior and a world of regression model have been applied in this a nice method so for online photo data only photo data could bring a rich of useful message for tourism research generally there are three popular platforms were applied in puri studies including flickr panoramio and Instagram Flickr was the most popular in theory studies but Instagram is getting more and more popular than Flickr now in the photo data collection process depending on your research purpose four elements also need to be considered such as user related information temporal information like when you upload the data and geography information and the textual information in the field of tourism research only photo data were used in analyzing tourist behavior present in tourism accommodations and promoting tourism marketing for choice behavior research researchers use only photo data to study visitors activity their travel rules such as where to travel and household travel and how long they stay in the destination awesome researchers use the photo data to discover a tourist origins based on the geography track the photos online photo have also been used in promoting tourism marketing therefore researchers define the destination attributes and destination image based on the online photo data in addition some researchers also compared the destination image reflected by user-generated content photo and the ammos photo in this way to find the gap between the perceived the destination image and the projected destination image because  'm not expert in only photo data analyzed so  'm not going to teach you how to do the analyse of photo data in this slide in the end of this part   would like to introduce the research ethics of applying user-generated content data in tourism research there is argument between companies and researchers company legally consider user needs to be company priority when you visiting their website you may found their policy like this the content and the information will go through the web page is belong to TripAdvisor companies and use the content so when you scrub the data from their website they may know what you are doing therefore their website gets a completed structure overhaul au-pair is free every six to nine months in this way to make the data scrubbing is more and more difficult but many researchers disagree with this company's behavior he said that data that does not be restricted access in the public website there should not be ethical concerns with collecting and analyzing this data so what you are going to use big data in your research you may consider these ethical issues or you need to apply agreement from the social media companies in the end   can recommend some software's for you for the dates are crawling passing is a powerful tool is free to download but it's difficult to use for someone who doesn't have lab who doesn't have program language skills web heavy this software   used one time it's little bit convenient for someone who doesn't have learn who doesn't have program language skills but you need to buy the license octopus is a free download software it's not cool to use and you can learn it in several days   use this software to collect my data from Chinese social media for data analyzing person and Lex Mansur will often use impure studies lexeme answer is a powerful interactive visualization tool but the little bit expensive for student   use in vivo in my study for students the prices per 100 euro for two years license and this software and this software could help you to quickly and automatically analyze the themes from the data and they also provide sent image analyze function this function cannot be found from at least ODI therefore   didn't use at last ODI and you know   have introduced a tourism big data research in pure studies now we will move to the second part and   will introduce my research topic analyze my sword and result and this episode we have the pleasure of hearing from Joshua Ryan Saha of the University of Edinburgh and he will be discussing how you can use data big or small to grow your tourism business this is a presentation you do not want to miss [Music] [Applause] yes it's a  'm gonna talk to you a My background little bit about data and tourism for some of you this might be a little bit basic for a visit might be quite insightful hopefully it'll be useful for all you my background  'll just sort of explain briefly before against the interesting stuff the first which isn't on air is  'm from Grimsby and it's important because if you from Grimsby it's very likely against tourism because everywhere you visit afterwards it's like a magical Wonderland so so that's why   go into tourism but but   did come quite late on my first job was from from going out to Grimsby was in the East End of London and believe it or not   was a neighborhood crime reduction officer in Green Streets  'm not in the film but that was an interesting start to the world of work Green Street if you know it is famous for football violence between West Ham and Millwall so anyway that's interesting start   then decided to move from a little bit safer which was Bosnia and   worked with a NGO there called Colette SIA one for free where we tried and horribly failed to change the Bosnian Constitution but that was an interesting experience   then moved to an organization called Nesta where we did some work with BBC and we try to set a massive grand challenge for what would be the biggest the biggest technological development incentivized by 10 million pound grant it was all on sort of on BBC horizon episode when   trying to vote for what would be the most important challenge it was infectious diseases which is actually very prescient right now especially for tourism   got somehow missed out of this boat Oh David Attenborough   don't know how  'm sure they regret it and then finally   moved up to Edinburgh to be part of the data lab which is the Innovation Centre for data in Scotland where   was heading up the work to develop date science skills and then a long work University of Glasgow long work with Strathclyde in GCU as well all around trying to get more date scientists but one of the things that started to do were   guess being a tourist to Scotland being a tourist to Edinburgh and getting to travel all around it understanding and thinking about technology made me just more interested in tourism and because   was working in data   started to work with Scottish Enterprise Scottish government and think about how data is applied to a tourism sector and   was fortunate enough to be offered a position in the city region deal University the University of Edinburgh was part of to look at how can we help grow the technology work in the sector first of all in Edinburgh but also in the surrounding region and then hopefully also to Scotland so one good talk to you today is a little bit about if you're a small business or or any type of business where   would start thinking about how to use data and then the second part really is some of the stuff that we've started trigger warning is a lot a bit it's quite a lot Edinburgh but   hope that's alright   think sort of kicked me out nothing about Grimsby so it's fine and so   Big data AI think the first myth around data and tourism or data generally it's all about big data AI that is exceptionally important and the opportunities there a massive but actually for a lot of any business just using data is really really variable and does anyone want to venture a description of data science   know how can we go so the way   like to think about it back to my time data lab is date sciences it's how you sort of extract knowledge using computational methods from big corpses of data of course you know  'm doing all of us use social media and watch YouTube and watch Netflix myself it's creating so much data all the time so the all this huge amount of data all this really really powerful computational processing power bringing those two things together you can make amazing predictions insights all this other stuff and but starting off   think as a tourism business is about what's happening outside your front door or what's happening at your front door being digitally or in in the physical world so the first sort of thing   always think about was when   had a conversation with a really good company based in Edinburgh doing work in Glasgow Scott beer tours now   was just chatting about you know where does data and tourism fit in and she just talked about Sarah she just talked about how the work she'd put into developing her CRM made her understand when people calling up their business and she realized that they just weren't really open to calls during that time so all this information going to see RSA our M system channelized they're her front door was closed and most important times and she also could then track how people would call and it's so basics  'm sure many of you go see our MSB was just really interesting to me because it also mapped on so the problem in tourism around things like productivity and actually the physical front bill being closed you know whenever   chat to visit Scotland they always talk about how in some parts of the highlands to be many many tourists and every business is closed because they just don't know who's outside which brings me on to a very weird example this is a the best picture of a butcher shop by the way you can't refined good butcher shop pictures which aren't like disgusting anyways now this is not it's not a big data example but it's   think quite an interesting one which is  'm not even sure it's true  'm gonna go for it but if you had a butcher shop   mean at the end of a road pub opens up and they realize that the footfall going outside a butcher shop it's pretty high during a day but after everyone's had a few drinks walked by there the football is really high about you know eleven o'clock twelve o'clock because all these revelers are going by so what does a butcher shop do well it could potentially kill cook it's off cuts   don't know the lingo brims was a fish place and you know and then serve them to hungry revelers and then they quickly find it they know creating more money from this particular investment now why is this relevant   think it just shows that if you're using any type of data you're understanding what's happening outside your front door then you can innovate you can start develop new products services you can potentially make more money and this is the reason   sort of took about that particular example which may be fictional is that this is borne out in studies so my time in Nesta they were saying that if you're using any type of data not just big data just using data to make decisions you're more productive you're more innovative and there is a boost to your bottom line so my first sort of tip   guess is don't get too hung up on the big data just start thinking about the data D do have especially thinking about when are people passing your digital or physical front door so the next part   need to Whats happening inside get best like this no no it's it's what's happening inside so we were just chatting me and Chris about what are some of the challenges facing tourism industry right now now one of them quite quite significantly a staffing we know that with Bret sir we know that with the new immigration rules that there's going to be an even bigger constraining of the pool of potential talent that you'd want to hire for your business and we know the costs are going up in terms of business rates and and all this other stuff and whenever you're in a situation where you're potentially having increased costs then you need to find potentially efficiencies and   think where data is useful internally is looking at your back office processes or really targeting how you use stuff and how you bring stuff into particular moments so this is a an example of some quite high-end research going play going on at the University of Edinburgh sort of Penn Factory in in Italy maybe it's not relevant  'm gonna go for it basically what they did is they put sensors into each of different components of the manufacturing process and what it started to do was actually show what the real process was if you had the one on paper but then when you can start to see where the product is moves around the factory floor it showed there was huge inefficiencies and then they could do something called process reengineering and it was actually been able to automate the development of new process and they were able to significant reduce costs and why it's important because whatever is happening in the tourism industry a lot of this is back-office stuff ba inventory management you know you're running out of this we can expect demand at this time of year to be going up maybe you should think about how can you automate those repurchases my dentist does it not for me my fee for great it's fine the other thing is is that how do you need to start collecting data about your internal processes   really like this example it's some great work this traffic lights been doing with fishes and they didn't have data on their linens and their and their towels and various things like that so they decided well let's understand what's happening with our product and they started putting chips inside of him chips inside bed sheets that's fun and you know   mean obviously was not like that anyone you're saying it's yes but but it really gave a good understanding of what their big board the business was we're all that the towels were going into my bag and you know all this sort of stuff but also about the lifetime of that particular product and you know when you when you're dealing with massive quantities understanding that means that it's really really powerful in terms of will approaching they're posting the raw materials is it going to stand how many washes and you can start making significant marginal gains by looking at the data and then interpreting it and they're making decisions from it so understanding what's happening inside your business but there is also big data Big data available right so even if you are looking at your small data there is big data but you can start access this is a Twitter map of Edinburgh so there's two colors one represents locals one represents visitors not guessing which color is which you know   live up on the Granton coast and  'd like to walk down to crema and and you know it's you know it's really interesting   think you're just sort of we talk a lot at the moment in Edinburgh around this idea of over tourism   think it's probably more around overcrowding in particular places and the big data that we do have starts to show that that's probably the case that you know we are not spreading the tourism population of visitor population into all the parts of the Edinburgh city but also dead in the region that we perhaps should be so that's that's one big source of data is social media data Twitter data can cost a little bit but if you can start to our ways you can start to back it up but it's really useful when thinking especially from a destination perspective now some really fun stuff does anyone use Google Trends here playing it so  'm sure a lot of you do it's like it's amazing it's like a wormhole this is it's one of my favorite ones which is just vegan food near me you know if you're a restaurant understanding trends and getting in front of them could be really really valuable you can do that partially weather can Instagram but just looking at Google Trends and you know in 2000 then you know 2017 you start seeing a significant increase in vegan food near me this only goes to the end of last year and  'm sure it's even gone it's gone higher   don't know when the Netflix documentary comes in  'm guessing it's around about here  'm not yet being advised because   don't dare watch that documentary the second one who's a millennial here that's just just anyway we love avocado toast right it's just beautiful what's this this is the point where a millionaire tells tells Millennials that you know you can't afford a house because you have too much avocado toast he was a wonderful chap   really like him and you know he didn't redo anything to damage the reputation  've encouraged so it just keeps on going up the other interesting thing here is that there's sort of like oh you know Christmas no one's really eating avocado case but in January everyone goes nuts for that so you know put that on your menu this is big data it's available for anyone it takes mere tweaking but it's good fun this is   did have one which had the Scottish in the and V sort of the other spelling of whisky   bowed there show it to a Scottish audience because it's not a good look especially when you're deserting in Scotland but but actually the last talk     went to   showed this   was able to use this graph to predict what present   got   don't worry  'm not expecting you know Ginny's overtaking it and this is massive spike for Christmas again so you know you can start to pick up on these trends over time and it's really really valuable it's big data it's free and it's about and this was just coffee near me   thought  'd discovered on a Tuesday coffee was a particular you know as a massive spike it wasn't what happened was Koster offered free coffee on that particular week it was interesting and now for specific tourism thing how many have you been to st. ABS on the East Coast beautiful place what's happened recently it was featured in Avengers it was it was a place called new Asgard in Avengers so what happens when it's been selected as a place for filming of Avengers it had a huge search increase when the film came out there's a massive search for new Asgard but also big increase in searches for say ABS and he might not look like much but there's quite a significant increase in the amount of searches for say abs what does that mean it probably means well more people obviously searching for say ABS more people probably want to go to say ABS we've seen it with Outlander you'll see it with Batman here  'm sure how do we start using this to better manage a tourism economy we've seen real positives around North Coast five hundreds but there were also negatives and we're seeing me know that feedback comes back comes back all the time the loads of people get to enjoy it but it's busy people trying to go fast other people trying to go slow how do you get ahead of problems before we arrive and and paper and freely available Big Data is a good way to start another tip this AI powered tools is a man trying to eat his phone well you know you got a start and actually  'm gonna have to give a little bit of kudos Toto Peter Peter in the audience EXI   heard of talk from him earlier and   was a few years ago   was making actually that's really important was there's a lot of AI powered tools but   out there now that but we should be utilizing and we can go to companies good ones and sometimes they don't work too well but it's actually just utilize what they have what we've got on offer so few things which are happening in a moment is image search you know if you take a photo you can actually search for our images how much how many of us optimizing that in our you know product offerings on websites or whether it perhaps not as many of us should be so for example if you want to find some funny dress or an outfit you like just take a picture of them stalk them and then you can you know search and find exactly that thing you know this is happening right now and we're not optimizing for it voice search of course is another another big area and there are companies out there for help sort of optimize for voice search you know all of this stuff it's not happen people start to utilize it and if you're a tourism company and you're small then maybe think about what is what is there from Waiver you can potentially get people to look for your your product of what you've got and Myths about data there's another myth about data and think your particular on tourism and festivals and other things that it's a it doesn't do any harm you know Tori data's good   mean this slide used to work there until like Cambridge on Whittaker in life or collapse of a democratic world but you know this is the happiest picture of a policeman in America   could find and it's just there's some interesting sort of ethical case studies   want to bring out one is the when police forces have used some of these data big data analytics projects what we often do is bake in things like discrimination because the data do you have was probably built on historically bad data yeah they can crap in you get crap out in a data analytic sort of way so if you have historically a discriminatory sort of police force that data is are baked into an algorithm then the stuff you get out is also going to be it's gonna be legitimizing the sort of discrimination against goes in and another example is bail decisions so if you're a you're a judge your firm us again is a good example then you know you're making the decision whether someone is going to be given bail or not then the data that you have is of people who have been given bail and committed a crime or didn't commit a crime what people who weren't given bail you never know the people who weren't given bail whether they were going to commit a crime or not that's a big data gap and the reason   mention it is that you have to be really wary when trying to make decisions from data those provided to you but you need to understand what data is going in to understand the potential fallacies that come out and that's relevant for tourism it's relevant for a for every sector one How do we capture data other thing around tourism in particular is some of the data we really would benefit from is understanding the flows of people in particular around cities and sort of best ways of capturing flows of people is quite getting everyone's face in a big database and obviously that's not particularly welcomed too many people rightly so and there's even really interesting things you can do now at the edge of computing which means your face is immediately deleted all this sort of stuff but if still not socially or ethically acceptable that moment so we need to always think about you know how do we Fe capture data how do we do it G deep are compliant of course but also what is the right way of doing it as well and there's other North Coast 500 things which is   talked about North Coast 500 in the South of England one Facebook post from a South Korean influence led to a massive Baelish of people going to a destination was completely unprepared this this basically they certainly have a South Coast these cliffs and people will go in taking pictures pretending to fall off and inevitably many people fell off so we but you know if you're using data in areas and destinations and all your developed we need to be thinking about you know don't just optimize the marketing optimize for what is you know real destination so there's a few examples   haven't in for time by the way  'm gone so while the trends what Challenges are the challenges one of the things that happening in data and tourism at the moment there's a really good report   recommend reading from London first that has started to access the big data is relevant for destinations and and tourism one of the challenges we have in tourism is our visitor number data is quite poor and the visit the information of business Scotland get from surveys it's been the best it's been the gold standard for so long eighteen months old when we get it and  've been working with business cotton to try and see how we can potentially improve that it takes a lot of time but one of the key ways is how do we work with big companies with big datasets London did it they didn't with mastercard video of Airbnb and what we started to do was understand but real spending across London because a lot of the boroughs outside of London will not really consider themselves a destination but they were now you cause you have some big hotspots right in the center but they were starting to look at MasterCard data and come up with a better sense of actually what was the real value of tourism in London and we'd love to do this we'd love to do this and we would love to do more of it in Scotland and start to get to better statistics and beyond surveys around who's here and when one of the projects we're trying to do is forecasting so we Forecasting have a project that we're recruiting for now if you know any post-op the researchers or machine learning experience - sure we all do - start predicting six months in advance how many visitors are coming to Scotland we're very potentially going and what are the details about those those visitors because if we can start to get a little bit ahead of it and provide that information to businesses so they can start to make some of those fine-tune decisions which   was talking about earlier using your front door how do you prepare - who's coming now he's always gonna be a risk here like forecasting probably wouldn't have picked up coronavirus right it wouldn't have picked up some of these other trends but we need to be getting better than the 18-month flag we currently have Amsterdam Amsterdam is a really good example of using data in a destination as well and for specific businesses within their destination it does help with a tourist tax create 185 million pounds apparently which is amazing and very invested in data acquisition and other things but what they did was access telecommunication data they use camera counters and what we were starting to do was build up a really detailed image and map around how people visitors in particular moved around the city and how they moved from different attractions within the city and then they were able to use that information for better digital signage but they also were able to better advise people are working in hotels every be hosts to say speak to guests today don't go there nine o'clock in the morning go there Aitor enabled but a very sort of analog or human intervention based on our data and what we trying to do in Edinburgh well we've Edinburgh got a project at a moment looking at how do you travel during the festival   don't know if any of you went to Edinburgh driven festivals in August last year none of you were there the last Saturday in a festival it was it was a bit of a mess especially coming back to Glasgow now why was it a mess only   wasn't running trains to London there was a Murrayfield rugby match there was a hips game there was a hearts game there was the fringe it was the last day of a fringe all this stuff coming together and then there was some some problems on scott reil and all those things and it was a really warm day so people having drinks stayed out late or everyone literally everyone gently gave a last train home to Glasgow and it didn't work and could this mean anticipate doesn't require big data to be honest but anyway it could have been anticipated but it's not just that there's loads of moments now that the festivals provide a real challenge people to get across the city and what we're trying to do is capture and share data from multiple partners to identify the moments where mobility wasn't good enough and trying from the data to understand what were the potential causes in particular matching events data from things like a Fringe Festival with low beam buses data to understand what is the correlation between business buses and and business of events in particular locations so this has taken a long time it's really complex but it's it's really worth starting and   think Transport is definitely an area where more than marginal gains can made from use of data this is an example in Chicago Chicago just really quickly they did as they just put sensors in the in the building and understand how long people dwelled outside the particular pictures they've been used those particular pictures in their marketing and sort of massive uplift so people interestingly you know won't see particular painting they went to see it you market about it and then actually increase in our people really basic and we're trying to do a similar thing Scotland we've got postdoctoral researcher starting soon who's going to look at museums galleries and tractions in Edinburgh how people flow through them interestingly one of the biggest complaints  've been told in the National Museum of Scotland was there's no Scottish history there's of course lots of Scottish history but the flow within that Sigma Z in a can sometimes feel not like it leads to the scottish history part so how do they look at the flow of people moving in and then optimizing for that  'm gonna skip across a couple some  'm a bit late but one of them one little project we try to do which is around data for advocacy and Data for Advocacy so grey fires Kirk obviously a important Scottish Historic Site we don't know how many people go there because it's an unmanned non ticketed attraction there's now loads and loads of tall groups going in there and   went in there about a week ago and it's looking it's looking terrible it is muddy you know this is a sacred site really and is people are trampling on it this is   think believe is over tourism in Edinburgh but this is an example of specific specific unmanaged tourism and so what we're doing well we're not anything incredible we're just gonna put a sensor on each of the entries and exits potentially look at the flow within and just so we can advocate for more investment in this place because at the moment it's run by the council and council ongoing cuts how can we better manage these places and how is data a part of it well advocacy Spada and a couple of final things be AI Chairs some chairs developed by an AI algorithm none of them look comfy eventually this is what was created and now that does looks beautiful not as nice as these lovely chairs but this is you know this is so creative see and and data and AI is thigns happen one of the big interesting projects within the universe favorite moment is something called create informatics and one of the flagship projects and this Fringe Festival comes from the Fringe Festival themselves is looking at new types of personalized recommendation so if you're Netflix you send people often maybe not as much anymore down the rabbit hole if you like this you'll also like this you like that you're like and then you know before you know it you're just watching sort of like a chef's table like 50 times in a row and same with sauce well Spotify has not actually like that but Amazon is a bit like that people like you like this now   there was a head of a BBC platform it's actually from Grimsby we're speaking in we're in Glasgow a couple years ago and he was talking about how does BBC do this stuff because it's remit it's not to send you down a rabbit hole you're very MIT is to educate inform you know all that sort of stuff and the same route of Fringe Festival the French vessels based on this sort of radical openness have you recommend on the idea of radical openness how do you recommend people to expand their horizons so that's what we're trying to do they're trying to think about the risk profile of individuals going to see fringe festivals so if you went to this show did other people go through our exact show and if they did whatever shows they see and can you recommend based on that and it's quite radical it's quite different and  'm creative Mattox program he's working with a small company and the French vessel to see how this is realized and fringe are always been quite cutting edge in terms of new technologies so this is a really interesting project  'm just gonna go to Data Analytics be a bit because  've gone on too long but the way   this is a some work by Eddy Copeland he wasn't Nestor and is now running the London office for data analytics it's not exactly that but he's really good person to look at and   always come back to this which is if you're doing data stuff you need to have a specific problem in mind you then need to think about what do you want in within your power or the collective power of people within your circle to respond to that particular action and then what you need to see in front of you that right moment to be able to enable you to make the action and it's only then you've gone through that part these should be thinking about what available data is it can really fuel that data product and there's a lot of people who often maybe have a lot of investment and Boring Companies maybe don't think about the specific problem this is   think a really interesting example of hearth wait you know musk you know  'm not saying he's   mean it's very clever man who's been amazing stuff he's gonna save the worlds but he he was said about boring companies gonna do this loop system of public transport thousands of small stations and you know everything's gonna blend into the fabric of a city he is basically developed and designed the Buffs top and the bus system you know he didn't start up a problem he started with interesting technology and actually this is not going to solve anything it's just like this is just buses fire what Data Lab do   mean there was a really interesting there's a really interesting project that when   was of a data lab which really started with the problem and what they did was they were providing equipment and it was quite high-tech equipment and what we realized that famous was just craft Ida stuff they realized that in fact equipments to go down it would cost huge amounts of money and also reputational damage and but they had data coming back from all each of these bits of high-tech equipment so they then studied the patterns about data and understood and could predict when the machine would fail so what we did they were able to get ahead of the problem they could start to recognize the trend go in fix it for is a problem and then they save money save reputation so we started a very specific problem interestingly this changed the way the engineers have to work for you speed of saviors going in fixing saving the day then they were sort of not seen as much the data changes your whole business it's really interesting so if one of them more about understanding data for tourism in a more specific coherent wave and  've just tried to do it and there's a good course and Renee proof set up Data for Tourism it's called understanding dates for tourism it's not often about big data but it's often about just getting started with data and   highly recommend that the next sort of iteration if is starting in a couple of weeks thank you ever so much for listening [Applause] thank you so much we're going to open up the floor to questions jessica is going to come round with her mate just so it gets packed up for the video so if anyone's got a question if want to raise that hand yep Cathy's get one yeah thank you very much Josh that was really interesting my name is Kathy  'm from watch Missy as a Scotland travel blog and  'm quite interested in the example that you give of the Art Gallery in Chicago that kind of analyzed how long people dwell in front of particular pictures and then use that to market the museum and get attract more more visitors  'm quite interested in the ethics of that if   think of how that can be applied to Scotland because if say for example we had this project that analyzed or are counted how many people go to which sites we would all know which sites would be the most popular ones and then   guess the ethical question is is do   promote these places even more or am   actually counting which places people don't stop and for more thoughts so quite interested in that kind of   don't know if this is actually a question or something you would like to comment on me but yeah  'm quite interested in that ethical point of view of how to use that data and how it is collected and how that can be used by different people in different ways so from the ethical side you would never capture any more Data Ethics information about that person apart from the fact that someone just stood there looking at a picture from   think it's almost like business side   was trying someone in Slovenia not but where he came over to Edinburgh today and and what they're trying to do is look at the hotspots at particular times and the sort of the the untapped amazing experiences that people are not using and how do they use incentive mechanisms to try and push people around a little bit and   think there's sometimes risks about that especially if you know you've got a popular destination that requires almost like huge you know it's invested in there a lot of people coming so you want to make sure that if you do use me incentive mechanisms you're not over incentivizing away from popular and well but places and and view incentivizing in a way that's responsible for the new destinations they open in place but for a place like Edinburgh at the moment where there are some very serious hot spots and there's a lot more to offer not just in Edinburgh but across Scotland   think it actually makes more ethical sense or moral sense   guess to start promoting places that would provide a different unique experience the interesting about of Chicago one is maybe the lobster for datum because they really rich and they charge tickets and one of the more interesting projects was they looked at the exhibition churn so what they were trying to understand was when in winter months locals came but we think come back and inverse summer months loads of people would come there's loads of visitors and you know it's quite simple when you think about it but just looking at the data dough well actually if we start putting on more frequent shorter may be locally driven exhibits we can increase the amount of local people coming and it had a massive impact on the bottom line so it's just like it's basic analytics baby this was really valuable for how they develop their their products and services the answer lies in kind of the question of the bike hi Josh my name's John Carson from Utah luggage and the question   have is if anyone here knows the Kelvin whole gym as you approach the car park to the gym and right hand side there's maybe every single space on the right hand side there's a disabled space and and   think there must be about 15 spaces in total and it would seem that   don't know how they calculate that but it would appear though your type of soft soft we're on eater analysis to see well actually the so many members so there will be approximately X number of disabled members which means at any one time number of people and at this point because it would appear that this there's too many disabled parking spaces at that point   don't think God's available   just want to know how they calculate that and   think if you can get a piece of software you can calculate that or in your data center   think that would be worth a lot of money well Kevin's here cuz it it's every single space must be a bit 20 of them there's company called Parker pedia Parkerpedia and  've sucks traffic powerstrap landlord say um University of Edinburgh anyway  'll talk about traffic lights and Morley grapes and they did it they did the project is a professor John Wilson who did project with park pd a-- and the lists theta sir so the list of these big events dataset parka pete you have a dataset around where parking spaces become available and they decided to use well can you use events dates predict open parking spaces so it's not exactly that problem but there is a big data set around parking spaces which and they seem to be quite open to as least academic research so they also did in edinburgh to start understanding one of problems is that in everyone august all the parking bays become bestest so that's yeah yes   think   think is probably a broader question there which goes bill Beck which is around how to use data for Bill Beck better infrastructure planning one of the articles that came over weekend about Edinburgh was about that essentially created too many hotel rooms or there's too many hotel rooms in pipeline and  'm not sure that's true because there's obviously new IBB regulation coming in if they don't be still very popular destination although admittedly the coronavirus far too many hotel rooms in Romania anyway but you know one of the projects we're doing which   haven't talked about is we're trying to work with Midlothian and south of Scotland with this in Scotland to start to have a look at a synapse problem potentially and so C is where potential gaps based on current demand future demand and current offer around where we should be prioritizing in tourism infrastructure spending it's quite a complex when it's quite difficult but it's a yes bit links about what demand is really there and are you providing for it now and in future say for one more that's a question okay  'll get one now yeah you mentioned over two dozen yeah is it real or is it just really bad planning both it's not really no bro   don't think   think there's bad but there probably is or it's we're not getting ahead of the problems   think there's in Edinburgh is just an example   think there's some really specific problems that we need to deal with not over tourism over tourism can be an emotional thing   think there are community challenges that we need to address air B&B is a very specific one where you know it's been used as a commercial thing and it's housing it is   think the great fires code for an interesting example but is more than that is also been a we're not calculating in real environmental cost as a nice tourism problems or tourism numbers sorry but this you know   was just an example that same Saturday   was talking about where the whole trains collapse and all these events have taken place   walked from the center of town he was really busy to West End in Edinburgh and there was no one nine o'clock can it was you know we're not we're not spreading visitors across the city and getting people experience more   think this   think it Fred in Britain's more to ever the Venice it's just yeah   think okay oh thank you for your team hope you get one George it so you know the the Amsterdam example that you had recently they change their kind of philosophy on tourism based on the data that they had of where people were going so the   heart Amsterdam that you had in that picture has now been removed because it was encouraging mass amounts of people that they couldn't deal with and   found that really interesting way to approach it because what they were saying is yes this is iconic but that doesn't mean that that should hate the way that tourists are coming to our city we should be giving them more and different things to come to so   when   saw that picture go off   was just like that's a really interesting example because they actually took direct action based on the how they saw people moving around and   just it was just that yeah   mean Localism Strategy there's a big localism strategy how'd you get in and they've got they've got the finger   understand this they have this tourism tax and they've got in an inelastic demand and they are able to generate huge revenues that's reinvested into the destination and it's to support residents of Amsterdam so it works really well when you've got that sort well good planning and financial muscle   guess but they still have huge problems as well mostly from British knack - yes thanks so much   appreciate you know thank you for taking everyone So, here's a prediction. If we get our cities right, we just might survive the 21st century. We get them wrong, and we're done for. Cities are the most extraordinary experiment in social engineering that we humans have ever come up with. If you live in a city, and even if you live in a slum -- which 20 percent of the world's urban population does -- you're likely to be healthier, wealthier, better educated and live longer than your country cousins. There's a reason why three million people are moving to cities every single week. Cities are where the future happens first. They're open, they're creative, they're dynamic, they're democratic, they're cosmopolitan, they're sexy. They're the perfect antidote to reactionary nationalism. But cities have a dark side. They take up just three percent of the world's surface area, but they account for more than 75 percent of our energy consumption, and they emit 80 percent of our greenhouse gases. There are hundreds of thousands of people who die in our cities every single year from violence, and millions more who are killed as a result of car accidents and pollution. In Brazil, where   live, we've got 25 of the 50 most homicidal cities on the planet. And a quarter of our cities have chronic water shortages -- and this, in a country with 20 percent of the known water reserves. So cities are dual-edged. Part of the problem is that, apart from a handful of megacities in the West and the Far East, we don't know that much about the thousands of cities in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, where 90 percent of all future population growth is set to take place. So why this knowledge gap? Well, part of the problem is that we still see the world through the lens of nation-states. We're still locked in a 17th-century paradigm of parochial national sovereignty. And yet, in the 1600's, when nation-states were really coming into their own, less than one percent of the world's population resided in a city. Today, it's 54 percent. And by 2050, it will be closer to 70 percent. So the world has changed. We have these 193 nation-states, but we have easily as many cities that are beginning to rival them in power and influence. Just look at New York. The Big Apple has 8.5 million people and an annual budget of 80 billion dollars. Its GDP is 1.5 trillion, which puts it higher than Argentina and Australia, Nigeria and South Africa. Its roughly 40,000 police officers means it has one of the largest police departments in the world, rivaling all but the largest nation-states. But cities like New York or São Paulo or Johannesburg or Dhaka or Shanghai -- they're punching above their weight economically, but below their weight politically. And that's going to have to change. Cities are going to have to find their political voice if we want to change things. Now,   want to talk to you a little bit about the risks that cities are facing -- some of the big mega-risks.  'm also going to talk to you briefly about some of the solutions.  'm going to do this using a big data visualization that was developed with Carnegie Mellon's CREATE Lab and my institute, along with many, many others.   want you to first imagine the world not as made up of nation-states, but as made up of cities. What you see here is every single city with a population of a quarter million people or more. Now, without going into technical detail, the redder the circle, the more fragile that city is, and the bluer the circle, the more resilient. Fragility occurs when the social contract comes unstuck. And what we tend to see is a convergence of multiple kinds of risks: income inequality, poverty, youth unemployment, different issues around violence, even exposure to droughts, cyclones and earthquakes. Now obviously, some cities are more fragile than others. The good news, if there is any, is that fragility is not a permanent condition. Some cities that were once the most fragile cities in the world, like Bogotá in Colombia or Ciudad Juárez in Mexico, have now fallen more around the national average. The bad news is that fragility is deepening, especially in those parts of the world that are most vulnerable, in North Africa, the Middle East, in South Asia and Central Asia. There, we're seeing fragility rising way beyond scales we've ever seen before. When cities become too fragile they can collapse, tip over and fail. And when that happens, we have explosive forms of migration: refugees. There are more than 22 million refugees in the world today, more than at any other time since the second world war. Now, there's not one refugee crisis; there are multiple refugee crises. And contrary to what you might read in the news, the vast majority of refugees aren't fleeing from poor countries to wealthy countries, they're moving from poor cities into even poorer cities -- often, cities nearby. Every single dot on this map represents an agonizing story of struggle and survival. But   want to briefly tell you about what's not on that map, and that's internal displacement. There are more than 36 million people who have been internally displaced around the world. These are people living in refugee-like conditions, but lacking the equivalent international protection and assistance. And to understand their plight,   want to zoom in briefly on Syria. Syria suffered one of the worst droughts in its history between 2007 and 2010. More than 75 percent of its agriculture and 85 percent of its livestock were wiped out. And in the process, over a million people moved into cities like Aleppo, Damascus and Homs. As food prices began to rise, you also had equivalent levels of social unrest. And when the regime of President Assad began cracking down, you had an explosion of refugees. You also had over six million internally displaced people, many of whom when on to become refugees. And they didn't just move to neighboring countries like Jordan or Lebanon or Turkey. They also moved up north towards Western Europe. See, over 1.4 million Syrians made the perilous journey through the Mediterranean and up through Turkey to find their way into two countries, primarily: Germany and Sweden. Now, climate change -- not just drought, but also sea level rise, is probably one of the most severe existential threats that cities face. That's because two-thirds of the world's cities are coastal. Over 1.5 billion people live in low-lying, flood-prone coastal areas. What you see here is a map that shows sea level rise in relation to changes in temperature. Climate scientists predict that we're going to see anywhere between three and 30 feet of sea level rise this side of the century. And it's not just low island nation-states that are going to suffer -- Kiribati or the Maldives or the Solomons or Sri Lanka -- and they will suffer, but also massive cities like Dhaka, like Hong Kong, like Shanghai. Cities of 10, 20, 30 million people or more are literally going to be wiped off the face of this earth. They're going to have to adapt, or they're going to die.   want to take you also all the way over to the West, because this isn't just a problem in Asia or Africa or Latin America, this is a problem also in the West. This is Miami. Many of you know Miami is one of the wealthiest cities in the United States; it's also one of the most flood-prone. That's been made painfully evident by natural disasters throughout 2017. But Miami is built on porous limestone -- a swamp. There's no way any kind of flood barrier is going to keep the water from seeping in. As we scroll back, and we look across the Caribbean and along the Gulf, we begin to realize that those cities that have suffered worst from natural crises -- Port-au-Prince, New Orleans, Houston -- as severe and as awful as those situations have been, they're a dress rehearsal for what's to come. No city is an island. Every city is connected to its rural hinterland in complex ways -- often, in relation to the production of food.   want to take you to the northern part of the Amazon, in Rondônia. This is one of the world's largest terrestrial carbon sinks, processing millions of carbon every single year. What you see here is a single road over a 30-year period. On either side you see land being cleared for pasture, for cattle, but also for soy and sugar production. You're seeing deforestation on a massive scale. The red area here implies a net loss of forest over the last 14 years. The blue, if you could see it -- there's not much -- implies there's been an incremental gain. Now, as grim and gloomy as the situation is -- and it is -- there is a little bit of hope. See, the Brazilian government, from the national to the state to the municipal level, has also introduced a whole range -- a lattice -- of parks and protected areas. And while not perfect, and not always limiting encroachment, they have served to tamp back deforestation. The same applies not just in Brazil but all across the Americas, into the United States, Canada and around the world. So let's talk about solutions. Despite climate denial at the highest levels, cities are taking action. You know, when the US pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, hundreds of cities in the United States and thousands more around the world doubled down on their climate commitments. (Applause) And when the White House cracked down on so-called "undocumented migrants" in sanctuary cities, hundreds of cities and counties and states sat up in defiance and refused to enact that order. (Applause) So cities are and can take action. But we're going to need to see a lot more of it, especially in the global south. You see, parts of Africa and Latin America are urbanizing before they industrialize. They're growing at three times the global average in terms their population. And this is putting enormous strain on infrastructure and services. Now, there is a golden opportunity. It's a small opportunity but a golden one: in the next 10 to 20 years, to really start designing in principles of resilience into our cities. There's not one single way of doing this, but there are a number of ways that are emerging. And  've spoken with hundreds of urban planners, development specialists, architects and civic activists, and a number of recurring principles keep coming out.   just want to pass on six. First: cities need a plan and a strategy to implement it.   mean, it sounds crazy, but the vast majority of world cities don't actually have a plan or a vision. They're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically.   mean, every city wants to be creative, happy, liveable, resilient -- who doesn't? The challenge is, how do you get there? And urban governance plays a key role. You could do worse than take a page from the book of Singapore. In 1971, Singapore set a 50-year urban strategy and renews it every five years. What Singapore teaches us is not just the importance of continuity, but also the critical role of autonomy and discretion. Cities need the power to be able to issue debt, to raise taxes, to zone effectively, to build affordable housing. What cities need is nothing less than a devolution revolution, and this is going to require renegotiating the terms of the contract with a nation-state. Second: you've got to go green. Cities are already leading global decarbonization efforts. They're investing in congestion pricing schemes, in climate reduction emission targets, in biodiversity, in parks and bikeways and walkways and everything in between. There's an extraordinary menu of options they have to choose from. One of the great things is, cities are already investing heavily in renewables -- in solar and wind -- not just in North America, but especially in Western Europe and parts of Asia. There are more than 8,000 cities right now in the world today with solar plants. There are 300 cities that have declared complete energy autonomy. One of my favorite stories comes from Medellín, which invested in a municipal hydroelectric plant, which doesn't only service its local needs, but allows the city to sell excess energy back onto the national grid. And it's not alone. There are a thousand other cities just like it. Third: invest in integrated and multi-use solutions. The most successful cities are those that are going to invest in solutions that don't solve just one problem, but that solve multiple problems. Take the case of integrated public transport. When done well -- rapid bus transit, light rail, bikeways, walkways, boatways -- these can dramatically reduce emissions and congestion. But they can do a lot more than that. They can improve public health. They can reduce dispersion. They can even increase safety. A great example of this comes from Seoul. You see, Seoul's population doubled over the last 30 years, but the footprint barely changed. How? Well, 75 percent of Seoul's residents get to work using what's been described as one of the most extraordinary public transport systems in the world. And Seoul used to be car country. Next, fourth: build densely but also sustainably. The death of all cities is the sprawl. Cities need to know how to build resiliently, but also in a way that's inclusive. This is a picture right here of Dallas-Fort Worth. And what you see is its population also doubled over the last 30 years. But as you can see, it spread into edge cities and suburbia as far as the eye can see. Cities need to know when not to build, so as not to reproduce urban sprawl and slums of downward accountability. The problem with Dallas-Forth Worth is just five percent of its residents get to work using public transport -- five. Ninety-five percent use cars, which partly explains why it's got some of the longest commuting times in North America. Singapore, by contrast, got it right. They built vertically and built in affordable housing to boot. Fifth: steal. The smartest cities are nicking, pilfering, stealing, left, right and center. They don't have time to waste. They need tomorrow's technology today, and they're going to leapfrog to get there. This is New York, but it's not just New York that's doing a lot of stealing, it's Singapore, it's Seoul, it's Medellín. The urban renaissance is only going to be enabled when cities start borrowing from one another. And finally: work in global coalitions. You know, there are more than 200 inner-city coalitions in the world today. There are more city coalitions than there are coalitions for nation-states. Just take a look at the Global Parliament of Mayors, set up by the late Ben Barber, who was driving an urban rights movement. Or consider the C40, a marvelous network of cities that has gathered thousands together to deliver clean energy. Or look at the World Economic Forum, which is developing smart city protocols. Or the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, which is leading a resilience revival. ICLEI, UCLG, Metropolis -- these are the movements of the future. What they all realize is that when cities work together, they can amplify their voice, not just on the national stage, but on the global stage. And with a voice comes, potentially, a vote -- and then maybe even a veto. When nation-states default on their national sovereignty, cities have to step up. They can't wait. And they don't need to ask for permission. They can exert their own sovereignty. They understand that the local and the global have really, truly come together, that we live in a global, local world, and we need to adjust our politics accordingly. As   travel around the world and meet mayors and civic leaders,  'm amazed by the energy, enthusiasm and effectiveness they bring to their work. They're pragmatists. They're problem-solvers. They're para-diplomats. And in this moment of extraordinary international uncertainty, when our multilateral institutions are paralyzed and our nation-states are in retreat, cities and their leaders are our new 21st-century visionaries. They deserve -- no, they have a right to -- a seat at the table Sunderland but some certain things   shouldn't tell can you please edit that out okay right  'm going to talk about the future of the world but  'm not going to tell you one thing  'm not going to tell you the lottery numbers for this weekend shame so M my name is Ian yeoman  'm actually   was born in Sunderland so that's the connection and   migrated all the way to New Zealand in 2008 so that's a long way away but has very strong Dutch influence discovered by a guy called Abel Tasman anybody know who he is no yes   can't see you for the lights mmm so   live in Wellington and got married in January so all you young ladies  'm spoken for so let's begin let's begin twenty fifty first slide please you've got the wrong presentation of yes so we'll see how this one goes shall we   wasn't prepared for this that's the old one Melissa edited this one and said   had to do the new one so   don't know what's gone wrong there anywhere let's start okay and this is where you have to do that ad lib stuff okay and that's the wife that's Vicki you're my wife and these are our honeymoon slides okay went to Thailand what  'm going to talk about is the world in 2050 these things that are constant and things that are things that will change and what are some of the things that a constant will be why will you go on holiday well we go on holiday it's all about families it's all about romance it's all about beaches the purpose of a holiday is to get away from the norm and that's going to be constant that's going to be that's not going to change okay so beaches romances and holidays are the most popular holiday choices today and they're still going to be the most popular holiday in the year 2050 that's not going to change the world is not going to be full of robots and it's not going to be about virtual reality but that's another conversation so what do   have to use this oh okay right so that's what that representation is well and well tourism's big it's massive 1950 how many people do you think went on holiday picking on that just you grandfather in 1950 25 million people took an international holiday 25 million people in 1950 if you got on an aeroplane you wore a suit and tie today we don't do that today approximately a billion people have gone on a an international holiday it's grown exponentially because fundamentally society's got richer there's more wealth there's more resources and there's been mobility so the world has gone and the world has travel United Nations World Tourism Organization is talking about 1.9 billion people taking a holiday in 2030 and about 4.3 billion people taking a holiday in the year 2050 so exponential growth and it's all about wealth it's all about access and it's all about those resources so  'm going to talk about a couple of things   haven't a clue what the next slides are going to be because they're all now muddled up but anyway so it's all about the resources that the future and the terms of the key drivers you need to understand where resources are you need to understand where technology is and you need to understand where wealth is who are going to be the richest people on the trouble because holidays and tourism it's fundamentally about that it's about wealth it's about disposable income so you need to know where those markets are coming from and what's going to change and what's going to be going to be and resourceful Dutch people you're the second biggest travelers in Europe the second biggest only one of the country takes more holidays than the Dutch and you know what country that is Germans but there's something about the Dutch you're the first to leave work you leave work the earliest than anybody else in Europe to get on that plane and go on holiday  'm not saying work is terrible in Holland but you're really into your holidays really into your holidays and really into them so we've got major challenges going forward and we've got major challenges in the terms of resources oil water land technologies change things we talked about all of these that combined and what does it mean so it's the future and eco-tourists a hedonistic tourist or a food tourist it's not it's about a little bit of everything the future tourist is like this this is me on my little holidays and mini bricks in New Zealand Europe and the South Pacific and if you look at that four corner right in the top right-hand corner that's me and my panamas hiking up mountains because in New Zealand we wear our underpants when we go hiking but you didn't know that or trampoline as we call it and what we do today is that what we like to do today as a tourist is we like the sample we want new experiences we have a desire to travel and see new cultures and just test and do new things in the terms of in the terms of that so we like the sample anybody here play cricket once if there you are you hello once upon a time if you played cricket unit in England or New Zealand or South Africa used to have to take five days off work to play cricket five days you know in nineteen 1910 1914 that type of thing today if you want to play cricket you only take the afternoon off because we've invented the game called twenty20 would change things and we adapt things we want to sample we want to see the novelty and dress that so consumers want to sample and experience so going forward it's about change what are some of the changes that we are going to see well first change that we'll probably see in the world there's going to be less young people and more awls people so what does that mean for tourism it means well if there's less young people that means in New Zealand there's less people doing bungee jumps you don't see the odd you don't see the 80 and 90 year olds jumping off cliffs in New Zealand if you come to do a bungee jump we guarantee you your money back if it doesn't work okay so fundamentally the tourism industry adventure tourism has major problems going forward because it's fundamentally a youth market and if you look at the hospitality industry the hotel industry labour supply is all about people under the age of 25 and there's just less of them a way so the tourism industry hospitality sector has to compete for that level with health care and retail some major challenges from a product perspective what we want to do is live longer if you born in Holland today you've got a 1 in 4 probability of living to your 100 100 on the boil vegetables no mushy carrots so fundamentally what we're doing from a tourism perspective what we want to do is what do we want to do  'm trying to think we get to the we retire at 65 is we want to have 12 years of good health than seven or eight years of dodgy health we're trying to extend those healthy years that's why you've got a big interest in health and well-being and hiking and going in holiday relaxation no stress at work in Holland however um  've got some fantastic news for you none of you are going to die somebody professor at Ronaldinho at Harvard Medical School has discovered the cure for death okay he's a professor in EM  've forgotten the disease what's a disease where your memory starts to go Alzheimer’s Minds kicking in he's a professor at an Allen findings you know look at looking at drug therapy and it's all about restructuring teller was trying to slow down the aging process and he's being able to pop is being partially successful in slowing down the aging process and reversing it in mice so that's the new detox so what else is going to change well it's all about the experience economy you know everybody talks is it all about virtual tourism but today in society we've changed the whole it's all about massive plasma screen TVs we like to build things up we like that in experience economy and today we go on holiday just what's the one thing that what first thing that you pack when you go in a suitcase what's the first thing you put in your suitcase your mobile phone 90% 95% of people are not only the first thing that they do is check emails for work so how it's just that inspiration how will technology change how about going on holiday to see this play maestro   can dance going on Holi that you know it's about a relationship with people and your Elvis put Paul McCartney's not dead Elvis John Lennon you know they will make their comeback to us in the year 2050 we recreate that type of experience so how will you travel in the future to things how about coming to New Zealand for the weekend hypersonic travel New Zealand in three to four hours in the 1800s you wanted to get to New Zealand care by alien ship would take you six months then he invented the what are they in bed but this the steamship takes you and six weeks and then they have aeroplanes 24 hours but come in a hypersonic how about one of these is the next generation of M aircraft carriers you know true ships are massive it's like 20,000 people stuck on this big ball for two weeks fantastic and going on holiday two things about going on holiday you know when you go on holiday now technology's changed everything Google glass is the next concept in wearable technologies it's not about mobile phones or smartphones anymore it's about that Google glass matching going on a date and somebody's wearing a Google glass they'll know everything about you before you open your mouth but this type of technology changes things use the tourists for example don't visit information centres because use your smartphone T to get there there's no such thing as the lost tourist how about the ability to read your mind well if you look at them egg capsule brain computer interfaces you know Samsung now has a tablet where you can use your mind to read it don't tell the wife that about that idea   don't want to know what  'm actually thinking so come back  'm just giving you a little flavour of what the future is all about what the future is all about is we don't know the point of it is just about let's just think about the future and some of the ideas that are coming forward because we know the future tourist is going to be more demanding more complex more for cystic acted wants something for a cheaper price but from a business perspective it's all about understanding that consumer and it's all about trying to reinvent your it's all about that novelty and that innovation keep on plugging and going and going and going on because we can't predict the exact future because somebody once said everything that has been invented has been invented or something like that anyway she wants to know more than you can probably read my book very interesting  'm going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology. We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought, perhaps rather timeless.  'm going to argue that, in fact, business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology, that those assumptions are changing, and, in fact, changing quite dramatically, and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy. Let me start, if   may, with a little bit of history. The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants: Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG, and Michael Porter, professor at the Harvard Business School. Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns -- scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. Porter agreed with that premise, but he qualified it. He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well, but businesses actually have multiple steps to them. They have different components, and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy. A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others. The two Big Ideas in strategy He formed the concept of the value chain, essentially the sequence of steps with which a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component, becomes assembled into a finished product, and then is distributed, for example, and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components, and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts. And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs, that in essence you need to coordinate, organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets, very often, and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs. It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected. Now what  'm going to argue is that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated. First of all, let's think about transaction costs. There are really two components to transaction costs. Falling transaction costs Processing vs communication economics One is about processing information, and the other is about communication. These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time. As we all know from so many contexts, they have been radically transformed since the days when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories. In particular, since the mid-'90s, communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs, which is why communication, the Internet, has exploded in such a dramatic fashion. Now, those falling transaction costs have profound consequences, because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together, and they are falling, there is less to economize on. There is less need for vertically integrated organization, and value chains at least can break up. Falling transaction costs ...allow deconstruction of value chains They needn't necessarily, but they can. In particular, it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another. That is not just an abstract proposition. There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened. A poster child example was the encyclopedia business. The encyclopedia business in the days of leatherbound books was basically a distribution business. Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen. The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along, new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper, and the encyclopedia industry collapsed. It's now, of course, a very familiar story. This, in fact, more generally was the story of the first generation of the Internet economy. It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation, or what we call deconstruction. One of the questions   was occasionally asked was, well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia when Britannica no longer has a business model? And it was a while before the answer became manifest. Now, of course, we know what it is: it's the Wikipedia. Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution. What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced. The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia created by its users. And this, in fact, defines what you might call the second decade of the Internet economy, the decade in which the Internet as a noun became the Internet as a verb. It became a set of conversations, the era in which user-generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon. Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale. It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job, and certainly a much cheaper job, than professionals in a hierarchical organization. So basically what was happening was that one layer User creation Negative polarization of scale economies: "small is beautiful" of this value chain was becoming fragmented, as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed. Phases of the "digital revolution" But there's another question that obviously this graph poses, which is, okay, we've gone through two decades -- does anything distinguish the third? And what  'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third, and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter-Henderson logic that we've been talking about. And that is, about data. If we go back to around 2000, World's stock of data a lot of people were talking about the information revolution, and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data was growing, indeed growing quite fast. but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog. We go forward to 2007, not only had the world's stock of data exploded, but there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog. And more important even than that, if you look more carefully at this graph, what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an  .P. address. It's on a server or it's on a P.C. But having an  .P. address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an  .P. address. It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to see patterns, an entirely new thing. If we run the numbers forward to today, it probably looks something like this. We're not really sure. If we run the numbers forward to 2020, we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC. It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present. And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected via an  .P. address. Now, if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points, a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten-thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data, this just in the last 10 or 11 years. This,   would submit, is a sea change, a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in. The first human genome, that of James Watson, was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year 2000, and it took about 200 million dollars and about 10 years of work to map just one person's genomic makeup. Really Big Inference Sequencing a human genome Since then, the costs of mapping the genome have come down. In fact, they've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed, to the point where the cost is now below 1,000 dollars, and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015 it will be below 100 dollars -- a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a 15-year period, an extraordinary phenomenon. Now, in the days when mapping a genome cost millions, or even tens of thousands, it was basically a research enterprise. Scientists would gather some representative people, and they would see patterns, and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals. But when the genome can be mapped for 100 bucks, 99 dollars while you wait, then what happens is, it becomes retail. It becomes above all clinical. You go the doctor with a cold, and if he or she hasn't done it already, the first thing they do is map your genome, at which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you, but they're starting from your particular genome. Now think of the power of that. Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting. Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before. This,   would suggest, perhaps it will take a while, but this will drive a revolution in medicine. Fabulous, lots of people talk about this. But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention. How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today? If your business is based on proprietary data, if your competitive advantage is defined by your data, how on Earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the value that's implicit in the technology? They can't. So essentially what's happening here, and genomics is merely one example of this, is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it, and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated. The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition From vertical to horizontal among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate. The polarization of scale economies towards the very small -- small is beautiful -- allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production. The scaling in the opposite direction, towards things like big data, drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve that scale. But either way, the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal. The logic isn't just about big data. If we were to look, for example, at the telecommunications industry, you can tell the same story about fiber optics. If we look at the pharmaceutical industry, or, for that matter, university research, you can say exactly the same story about so-called "big science." And in the opposite direction, if we look, say, at the energy sector, where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy, that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon. That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale. Either way, what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries, and that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy. It means, for example, that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure, where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy, not something that the strategy presupposes. It means, for example, we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. Think about the genome. We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously. And we need industry structures that will accommodate very, very different motivations, from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments, or, for that matter, cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing, because that is the only way that they can get to scale. These kinds of transformations render the traditional premises of business strategy obsolete. They drive us into a completely new world. They require us, whether we are in the public sector or the private sector, to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business, and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again. my talk will be in English   live in Portugal   lost my job with the pandemic in a five-star hotel and   decided to become a trainer and since then   started going deeper about sustainable tourism and that's what  ’m here to talk today traveling is one of the most enriching experience a person can have and when we travel we get in touch with some of the most precious things in the world such as connecting to people and their culture and therefore   normally say that the tourism is the industry of dreams and memories now   invite you all to take a deep breath and if you feel like close your eyes open your heart and follow my voice imagine you have just arrived in Cabo Verde for a holiday that you've been planning for so long you feel the warm wind in your face and start connecting to the energy of the people and the place you are ready to explore the first stop is an open sky art gallery [Music] welcomes you on a perfect painting reflecting the cape virgin culture music and identity the screens are the colourful walls around you it's a hot day and it's a time for a watermelon experience and you are going to try the best fresh kina calabasara in town feel the fresh sweet and sour taste in your mouth you have just visited hua dart integra branca praya and now we are ready for a memorable sunset you have just arrived in a very small picturesque beach feel a breeze and listen to the calming sound of the waves the colours in the sky are a mix of yellow and orange and visualize the big round yellow sun going into the sea in murder beach south new day new experience you are walking around the beautiful colonial style of san Philip in Fogo in front of the city hall there is a square and you are surrounded by all of this beautiful coloured sobriety a colonial heritage and few steps away you have one of the most big beautiful beaches in comfort a white totally black sanded which at the sun it looks like golden sprinkled and the strength of the waves make a white blanket lace this is a unique beauty imagine after this having a good trooper in siddha vela and you outside enjoying a grog or a punch and suddenly you open your eyes and you are under one of the most beautiful starred sky you've ever seen it's almost galactic these are the kind of memories and experiences we want the tourists to take back from comfort based on authentic and sustainable experience and now let's get back to reality talking about sustainable tourism is one of the fastest growing sector in the world however if it's not well managed it can have devastating impact in our environment people and their culture therefore destinations must adopt a real sustainable tourism model in order to keep the balance according to the world tourism organization a sustainable tourism destination must preserve the environmental resources and protect the biodiversity respect and preserve the culture of the local communities at the same time benefiting them address the needs of the visitors and the industry whilst providing common economic social economic benefits to all and in order to convert to have a real sustainable tourism model it's necessary few things to happen firstly we have to change the paradigm from the business as usual model where the profit comes on the first place to a real sustainable tourism model where people and planet comes first and that means that it's just not enough to build plastic free hotels install photovoltaics plants if by the other hand we're having open sky dump burning 24 hours a day and sending all of this toxic gases to the atmosphere it's just not enough to create jobs and boost the economic situation of the country if by the other hand we're still having people struggling to have access to schools or even to a healthcare or even to water that doesn't work in order for that to work we have to install the portable tax plan and have a waste management system we have to make the economic benefits for the country which we thank for because we need it but also make sure that our local community is benefiting is having access to school to water to health that's important secondly we have to stop looking what is wrong or what we don't have and we have to start looking for what we did right and what we have so when we start doing that we identify also the challenges we have within our society and the environment and then build a tailor-made model that creates a common benefit value chain for all the stakeholders so if we want to have a real sustainable tourism in cub earth we can also use the principle of the circular economy and apply to tourism these are the three basic principles reuse reduce and recycle and when we start doing that we use what we have already and we can bring back to life our identity and the um authenticity and there are some people that did it right in Cabo Verde actually and let's see some examples this is a hotel in boa vista this brought back to life an ancient farmer and fisherman village abandoned on the 80s and it respect the authenticity and the identity of the place they used local materials to rebuild which lowered the impact on the construction 70 percent of the electricity is generated by photovoltaic plants in this hotel and they have a local restaurant with local cuisine that is also supplied by the small farmers and fishermen nearby which helps to reduce the food waste to reduce the cost of importing and mainly to support the local economy there is a similar project in japan that started in idea valley in tokoshima they started in one house and now they extend it to the whole country another project that it's a perfect example how to use circular economy in tourism it's a Taser project this project was created in love in 2010 and mainly Tarzan use the knowledge of the artisans combined with the technology and design and transform ancient art into actual usable goods and that generates a social economy that promotes not only the culture but also assists in the passing by the information or teaching the new generation to take it to the future taxa is now available in almost the five star luxury hotels in the Algarve selling their products and you can buy something easily a basket that cost 120 euros so if we want to repel to replicate that or to scale up a sustainable tourism model in cape Verde associated to what we have already in Santo Anton and sunny cloud we can use these things we can create a program that allow us to rehabilitate our historic buildings bring back to buy to life our ancient villages we can also implement strategies that allow our local communities to welcome and accommodate tourists in their own house but with all the health and security that we need that also improves the life quality of the people we have to teach to our younger generation our ancients our techniques and these products can get a new usage this is my favourite scarf and   challenge one of the designers of cup where to make this one of the most desired fashion item why not we can all of these products can get new usage they can become usable today or we can just have workshops how to make them another thing that in my opinion it's a little bit left behind you all know these fans do you who doesn't know you don't know where they are from okay these vans are so characteristic from Santiago north did you ever wonder which is the storytelling behind them why do they use all of these colourful covers with the international bands with the football clubs can it be used for tourism purpose can we do something with that that is something very characteristic from that area and that's our goal we have to find what we have within our community and see how we can use it for a modern age even not for tourism purpose in my opinion   think that is something that is worth to be protected and preserved make the story telling and pass them to our next coming generation maybe it's it will stop next few years and we will lose it and we don't know what's behind these kind of strategies helps not only the tourism but can be also a boost for the local community especially on the remote areas however all of these strategies have to come together with a marketing plan that have to reposition cape Verde as a sustainable tourism destination not only sale and Bovisa and beaches and so because we have much more to offer to our tourists than all-inclusive resorts where people get unlimited food and drinks and limited burn skin and that's what we are offering now but we have much more than that [Applause] so   hope that you all that heard me today are now looking forward to do all of this experience and we'll run together and have a fresh quest or even you just had an idea of what to do with your granny's house at somewhere with the sky full of star those that are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones that do it only takes one person to make positive change   was born in India soon to be the most populated country in the world with 1.3 billion people it is a magnificent country full of Rich culture and Heritage it is also the world's biggest democracy and it has 22 official languages and as most of you know it has some of the world's best cuisine Social Problems in India however India also has a lot of social problems it is the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world there are 300 million people living in India whose homes do not have electricity 300 million people in the top 10 list of most polluted cities in the world India has five and   was born in one of them New Delhi the capital of India just to put into perspective how densely populated this city is it has 23 million people and the size of the city is one-tenth the size of Sydney so you've got the population of Australia in one tenth the size of one of its major cities   don't have many memories of my childhood in India but what   do remember is   used to think we were rich   only found out later in life that we weren't very rich at all but   was always surrounded by family   felt the love of my parents and   remember living down the road from my grandparents who   was very close to   also vividly remember suffering from asthma and constantly going to the doctor to be treated which makes a little sense being one of the most polluted cities in the world when   was eight years old we moved to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea now this couldn't be a bigger contrast to India the place that   was born it has fresh air Wide Open Spaces Lush rainforest beautiful ocean one of the richest Melanesian cultures in the world we didn't have Cinemas we didn't have shopping centres what did we do for fun we went fishing we went hunting we played tennis in squash the things that you should do as a child in 2013   moved to the Cook Islands with my wife the Cook Islands is this tiny little place in the middle of the South Pacific and the population of the whole country is 15 000 people it is one of the most beautiful places in the world white sand beaches crystal clear water palm trees what dreams are made of   got married in aitutaki in the Cook Islands which in my opinion is the most beautiful place on Earth in 2015   moved to Fiji and it is still my home again another vibrant Melanesian culture the world has a lot to learn from the Fijian people about their gratitude for life it is a special place that also has beautiful islands and palm trees and the most beautiful ocean as a young adult   used to travel back to India about once a year and most of the time it was it was to visit my grandmother and grandfather but what   do remember vividly is every time   used to go home back to India   used to enjoy it less and less and at the time   couldn't figure out why normally you want to go back to where you're born and where you're from it was only when   got older   realized that   didn't enjoy going back was because every time   set foot outside of my door all   saw was pain and suffering poverty is on a different level in India it's not about not having enough money to go to the cinemas it's about parents not being able to feed their children 200 million people live under the poverty line in India and   felt helpless   was just one person what could   do   tried   donated money to a school in the slums   paid for a child's education but that was just tiny drops in the ocean so the only way   could deal with it is to block it out   used to want to go out less and less when   was in India when my grandmother passed away in 2017 that was the last time   visited India and   have no intention to return my life changed on the 5th of May 2016. that was the day my son Taj was born and four years later my daughter Ivy was born as most parents know it changes your world having children filled a hole in my life that   didn't even know existed you start to look at things differently you've got a different perspective on life you look at how do you invest in their education in their future how do you protect them from the world and   also realized   could no longer just have those blinders on and say   can't do anything my greatest fear is that in my lifetime the South Pacific the oceans the rivers the land will end up looking like what it's like in India and what will happen to us then we'll kill on the marine life tourism numbers will drop because te Fiji is no longer that pristine beautiful place and those two being the two biggest industries poverty will increase people will struggle to make ends meet this is a story   know very well Sustainable Tourism it was also around this time that   realized that in my career in the tourism and hotel industry   had the power to be a force for good   could help change tourism is the biggest employer in the South Pacific and also the biggest income earner so   am what   like to call a sustainability champion now  'm not the person who does all good  'm certainly not the one who does all the initiatives but   am that person who's always nipping at the heels of management and owners and my colleagues saying what can we do more how can we do better how can we protect the environment how can we divert some more money that we are earning towards the communities that we operate in  've been blessed to work for some amazing companies during my time in the South Pacific and  've been a part of a few extraordinary initiatives we've banned plastic straws band plastic single-use Plastics gotten rid of all those tiny bottles of shampoo and conditioner and bath soap and replace them with bulk amenities we've donated tens of thousands of dollars to Fiji Cancer Society this is what every tourism business in the South Pacific should be doing Sustainability Champion imagine if there was a sustainability champion in every tourism business in every Department in every family what we don't want is our beautiful South Pacific to look like what we see in Asia our beautiful ocean filled with trash   had an extraordinary experience about a month ago um  'm a scuba diver and   was diving one day near where   live and it was nine o'clock in the morning and   was 20 meters under the ocean surrounded by this deep blue you know all the soft corals of Fiji bright coloured fish and as   looked into a cave   saw a turtle looking straight at me it had obviously been sleeping from the night before but as soon as it saw me it swam towards me and it turned away and swam away and   remember in that moment thinking wow   am so lucky   get to see this beauty face to face 20 meters under the water fast forward eight hours and   went for a walk on the beach with my family my wife and two kids and to my dismay what had washed up on the beach was pieces of plastic absolutely everywhere we picked up handfuls of plastic in our 50 to 100 meter stretch of Beach and when   realized that that if that Turtle had swallowed any of those pieces of plastic you would be dead   had this feeling of Despair is this who we are as human beings maybe   am just that one person and   can't make any change and then despair turned to Hope without being prompted my six-year-old son walked over and started picking up rubbish with me and as the two of us collected the trash and took it over to the bin my three-year-old daughter said good job Daddy and   felt hope that through education of our children through leadership through a sustainability champion in every tourism business in every Department in every family we can make change who is your sustainability champion mine are my children Taj and Ivy it only takes one person to make positive change those that are crazy enough to change the world are the ones hello so today  'd like to talk to you about the coast and our relationship with coastal areas that we visit as tourists so yes this means soft sandy beaches and scenic jagged cliffs and the escape from our daily lives that coasts often represent to us but there's a problem here right if we're going to these places to escape from our daily lives to take a break from our responsibilities and we're going not long enough to experience the consequences of our actions and the dynamic that we have is one where we're tourists who are consumers and the places that we're visiting are the products that were consuming we're not exactly set up well to create a positive impact to put it diplomatically but we could we could make a positive impact and we could do it fairly effortlessly this message today isn't one a fault and lecturing about responsibility is probably not going to work given that when we vacation we're taking a break from our responsibilities right so instead   propose that we just tweak our perspective a bit and we just think about ourselves as visitors when we go to these places and start to think about ways that we can participate and something that   like to call smart tourism is defined as the act of What is Smart Tourism traveling for recreation and tourism as an industry has become a big part of the global economy according to the WTO tourism now accounts for 10 percent of the global GDP and one in 11 jobs it's a lot right so smart tourism is this idea that tourism can support economic growth and environmental conservation that it can encourage locals and tourists to communicate and interact to develop empathy and cultural understanding and even support coastal communities resilience to sudden or unexpected challenges so  'd like to note that there's already a lot of really smart people all over the world working towards these goals but there's a big potential impact that we can make as individuals when we are the tourists so how do we do this the first thing we need to do is recognize that when we travel to new places we are visitors right and then we can ask ourselves this question of if  'm the visitor then who's the host and the answer is quite obviously hopefully is the space is that we are visiting and the people plants and animals that call it home and this is an important mind-set to have right it encourages us to respect where we go and it's also   think   think a lot easier to understand the dynamic the relationship between a visitor and a host much more than we can understand the relationship between a tourist and a place so now  'm going to give you three How to be a Smart Tourist easy ways to be a better visitor and participate in smart tourism so the first thing that you can do is respect the locals not like this photo do not do this so don't be a stalker right so  'm sure we can all agree that when we are in new environments are really at any time we do not appreciate being stalked or harassed by the wildlife right and we certainly don't enjoy being stereotyped by other people so give the wildlife their space and when you travel to new places see people as people the second thing that you can do is use reusable don't be a garbage monster use a reusable cup our reusable straw eat in at the restaurant   know it doesn't always feel practical or convenient to do this right to avoid using single-use items but you know that there's times when it's completely effortless to do this to avoid that flimsy plastic cup that plastic straw that Styrofoam or polystyrene to-go box Target Your Money think about ways and start to be more aware of opportunities to reduce the waste you leave behind in these coastal communities the third thing that you can do is target your money use your consumer power look for businesses that are already contributing and supporting their local community and the local environment businesses want to sell what you want to buy right so tell these businesses that you appreciate their efforts for souvenirs look for local crafts rather than imported manufactured items for excursions or day trips buy directly from the company that is operating that activity you're probably going to get a better deal and more of that money is going to go to that community so watch where your money goes does it go into the community that you're visiting or does it go somewhere else you've learned hopefully a little bit about smart tourism and have a few ways easy ways to participate so hopefully on your next trip you start to think of yourselves as visitors and see the people places and natural world around you that you visit as gracious hosts rather than products for you to consume so thank you so much for listening and happy exploring hello so today  'd like to talk to you

We're blessed and honored to welcome people from all over the world. Tourism represents about 80 percent of the valley's economy, so we've realized that a lot of people come to the Chamonix Valley to admire Mont Blanc, but they don't necessarily go up the mountain to look at it. Our goal, of course, is to get them to go up there to see the view, which is a revolutionary tool for the company du Mont Blanc. It allows us to analyze millions of technical data points anonymously from mobile phones and understand where our customers come from, how they move around through the valley, and how long they stay collecting this data, which will allow us to increase customer satisfaction. Should we keep our tourist offices in the town centers? Should we set up mobile desks throughout the valley? Maybe deploy tourist office trucks to meet people where they are and provide information? Analyzing the data will allow us to better understand our customers. increase the use of ski lifts optimize the incoming and outgoing flow of visitors in transport and in train stations, and increase teams according to the size of the crowds. In short, improving our operational efficiency allows us to closely tailor our marketing strategy. That's how Orange is helping us create value. We now know who our visitors are and where they come from, so we can offer them relevant products and a perfect service to give them an unforgettable experience in the chamonix. Did you know that every day we generate data that exhausts the digital footprint we leave? This is tremendous, especially in the tourism industry, which we are going to explore today. The use of big data is impressive. This is shallow. She wants to go on a holiday, and she isn't the only one. In fact, Singapore residents made eight point three, six million outbound trips by air last year. Tourism is a booming industry in most countries. This means there is a flood in the volume of data generated at an increasing velocity. For example, in only a nine-month period, there were close to 200,000 tweets from the Great Barrier Reef region in Australia. Tourism data is also arriving at a pace much faster than traditional structured data ever did, with master card transactions alone nearing the 160 million transactions per hour from more than 210 countries. This tourism data comes in a variety of formats, some structured, like the number of tourists and length of stay, and some unstructured, like online reviews and photos. clearly the tourism industry is a great example of an industry where big data and the 3 vs volume velocity and variety come into play increasingly businesses involved in the tourism industry have to find ways to profit from this data let's trace Charlotte's journey to find out how big data is used by businesses every step of the way it all starts with the consumer Charlotte has to find the right hotel she goes on to hotels.com to find one that she likes this is where these hotel booking websites have to quickly capture the interests of potential customers like Charlotte or else these customers will abandon their services to search for another that suits them and indeed this was a problem that hotels.com faced often people exited your website without booking a hotel to tackle this challenge hotels.com used an assortment of analytics it used descriptive analytics in the form of web usage mining to extract data on what users have searched before landing on hotel comm it also used predictive analytics to infer the demographic of the user for example if Charlotte was looking at Japanese Hotel ratings on another website she is probably planning to visit Japan and the predictive model will identify her as such Finally, when the user lands on the hotel comm, the prescriptive analytics layer uses decision logic to recommend and rank a tailored list of hotels for the user. It is important to note here that there is a feedback loop: did the user click on the recommendations and make a booking? This information is fed back into the system to either validate the model if she was making a booking or to modify the model if it was inadequate in retaining the user. This streamlines the customer decision-making process. Hotels.com has since seen higher conversion rates, which means higher profits. Meanwhile, over at Marriott's end, the prices of hotel reservations are highly elastic, influenced by many factors like demand, time of year, and whether they are charged too much and you end up losing revenue to lower prices, competitors charge too little, and you end up with wasted opportunities. How much to charge Marriott International uses predictive and prescriptive analytics to find out that this was a practice that started in Starwood Hotels, which have since merged with Marriott International. Starwood integrated and analyzed information such as real-time data, which includes external data on local and global economic factors, events, and weather reports, and Osetra internal data like cancellation and occupancy revenue per available room, reservation behavior, average occupancy rate, and gross operating profit per available room. This data enables Marriott to predict customer behavior and derive optimal prices based on the results of its real-time analytics and demand forecast. For example, on a rainy day, North American consumers are more willing to spend four weeks of vacation in the Caribbean. The revenue optimization system will automatically adjust rates. If customers are willing to pay more, then it makes sense to charge higher prices with these analytics. Starwood managed a five percent increase in its revenue per room within just one year, and today Marriott is able to maximize its profits and ensure adequate staffing. Investing to build new hotels is always a risky business. In 2010 alone, there were two thousand and five hundred hotels in the United States that were not doing well, and they accounted for a nearly 40 billion dollar loss. Where and what kind of hotels to build is always a heavy question, but fortunately for Marriott, it was able to enlist the help of Buxton, a customer analytics company that possesses detailed data on 116 million households. This wealth of data includes information like the frequency of travel, and using this information, customer profiles can be created. Marriott was then able to identify where and why people travel; furthermore, analytics was used to predict where the unmet demand for new hotels is. Prescriptive analytics then point to the optimal location and type of hotel to build. After all, the kind of hotel you are going to build in Singapore in a middle-class district versus the type of hotel you're going to build and the beach in Bali is going to be very different. Using analytics, hotels like Marriott are able to decrease investment risks and potential debt. They are able to build hotels that provide customers with the best experience suited to their personalities. Now that she has the hotel settled, the next thing she needs are airplane tickets. Retaining the potential customer at this point is very critical, especially because airlines have always operated on raises in profit margins. Besides, global low-cost carriers have been intensifying competition and weakening the profit position of airlines like Japan Airlines. To take the example of Japan Airlines, it has been facing another problem as well. It has a huge wealth of data, yet previously it did not know how to create value out of that data to turn this situation around. Japan Airlines collaborated with NEC. The project employed artificial intelligence to analyze excess logs and other data from a flight booking website run by the airline's It also conducted predictive analysis for the purchase of airline tickets. the predictive analysis may use of internal data from the booking engine such as web access logs member information passenger boarding history and the routes chosen by the members now this allowed Japan Airlines to segment their members using classification and clustering algorithms and predict the willingness to pay for different segments and this allowed them to target not only current members but new potential customers as well how so well for current members they can send notifications of targeted special offers at appropriate times for new potential customers like Charlotte they can cross-reference their user behavior details such as referral sources from current members to predict their preferences willingness to pay and hence implement dynamic prices Such tactics enable airlines like Japan Airlines to price according to demand and maximize profits. Now that she's got her tickets, she's off aviation. Fuel doesn't come cheap, and a plane like a Boeing 747 uses approximately one gallon of fuel every second. Running efficient flight operations requires insights into dozens of variables, such as operating conditions, trajectories, fuel usage, weight, and balance across flights and fleets. Legacy systems kept much of this data separate, so it has traditionally been difficult to understand how they were using their fuel. This is why Japanese airlines use the Go Direct Flight Efficiency System, which was created by Honeywell Aerospace. this is an optimization tool using prescriptive analytics it brings together all the flight variables such as flight plans and weather into one place this gives Japan Airlines a comprehensive look at fleet and environment data this allows Japan Airlines to drill down and optimize flight paths select the best procedures and excess trade-offs between flight distances and fuel burn it is estimated to save Japan Airlines between 20 million and 60 million per year shallots in Japan she wonders where the best places to go are so she decides to ask the tourist information counter the kind lady at the counter tells Charlotte that the sun'll festival is happening at here shrine and how does the lady at a counter know what campaign shall up my like The JTP Corporation used analytics to find out that this effort started in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, which negatively impacted the tourism industry. The Japanese tourism industry tackled this by identifying tourist hot spots that could potentially be key appeal attractions to further expand the tourist market in Japan. Well, how exactly did they identify these? They made use of anonymized data ranging from mobile GPS coordinates and social media streams to the general history of mobile use. This helps JTB find out where tourists arrive and depart, the routes they prefer, their length of stay, and whether they use accommodations. Data is analyzed in two ways: The way tourists travel in the region can be analyzed through descriptive analytics, providing insight on their pattern of movement. Building upon these descriptive analytics JTB coordinates with other businesses along the routes frequented by tourists to maximize tourist dollars. JDB can also forecast and predict areas with relative potential but less travel. This allows JTB to promote areas overlooked, usually by tourists, but unlikely to appeal to them. JD B's approach is not new similarly singapore tourism board has also declared access to telecommunication big data they are able to apply their own analytics network to summarize tourist patterns to make predictions with respect to the race of the tourist for example the timing in which a particular race of tourists make a switch to a higher tier a week has passed and Shallah thoroughly enjoy his day IV lien at the airport she gets approached by a lady working at JTB she comes out with a survey phone this is how the Japanese tourism agency knows that they are doing their job well the aim was to find out more about the market they want to know how tourists view the image of Japan so that they can better target their market and develop more appropriate tourism products and make destinations more attractive Surveys have been given out to tourists at airports and seaports. They tested the attributes of satisfaction, overall satisfaction, and intention to return, as well as questions regarding the demographics of the tourists. The information collected was then placed into the decision trees for categorization. It might not seem like big data, but just in 2010, 4000 surveys were given out to determine the reasons for attention, return, and satisfaction. Simply reporting the conclusion is descriptive, but they are using this descriptive layer to find out if their current strategy driven by analytics is working. This empowers them to modify accordingly and optimize strategies to create new demand. This is where it gets prescriptive. To end off, we would like to put forth a quote from Jack Ma. Someone in the big data scene mentioned that for the last 200 years, standardization has been the trend. In the coming 100 years, customization will be key. This will be a challenge for lodge cooperations unless they embrace big data. In this era, the expectations of customers are getting higher and higher, and they want to feel special. They want a personalized experience. This rings especially true for the tourism industry. How do we create unforgettable moments for these customers and make the tourism scene blossom? big data Analytics has the ability to crunch the vast digital footprint left by tourists every step of the way. It empowers businesses to predict customer needs and provide the best recommendations to suit your preferences to feel valued, and that makes all the difference. hello everyone welcome to the big data training program in this video i will talk about big data in tourism tourism is one of the largest industries in this world not only providing a large number of jobs but also promoting exports and economic prosperity more than 390 million jobs around the world are offered by tourism this represents light about 10 of the jobs in the world related to the tourism over the past five years the tourism industries have contributed one-fifth of the new global employment and projections indicate light 100 million new jobs will be created in the global tourism industries over the next 10 years how can the tourism industry benefit from big data tourism industries can benefit from big data of this type in many ways that includes pinpointing marketing campaigns offering packages tailored to visitors in likely interests and deciding which countries to focus on winning customers in this insight can be a great help in the decision making progress and improve how the tourism industry operates players in the tourism industry can now make informed decisions on the basis of analytics and member-driven data it can identify targeted groups or potential customers at an every stage in the trip planning process big data can even be used to predict which new products might work well in their market tourism big data includes data generated by all segments of the tourism industry including information from suppliers agents travelers and tourism management and also includes information about the environment events and the disease that may affect tourism tourism data has great value and can be analyzed to improve the tourism industry by analyzing tourism data we can predict tourism demand effectively which can provide references for tourism policy making in general tourism demand is an important basis of the government to do tourism planning and the tourism demand prediction can ensure the cooperation between the supply chains of tourism services the content of tourism demand includes hardware demand which is a demand of tourism facilities supporting facilities for example transportation facilities accommodation facilities and the tourist attractions facilities and so on software demand which is a demand of tourism services including our guides scenic sports introductions and so on the construction of hardware facilities is a slow and the continuous growth size and its demand is easy to predict tourism services are seasonal not storable and intangible and frequently change which can cause coastal risks if there is a large difference between the expected demand and the reality therefore tourism services are an important component of demand forecasting for suppliers or agents of tourism if tourism demand prediction is inaccurate they may be inadequately prepared affecting the response time the quality of services and the visitor experience using big data we can gather massive tourism data together to achieve an accurate prediction of tourism service demands making tourism planning more effective and create more value and analyzing the tourism big data it is possible to make a detailed classification of the tourism market and then launch targeted tourism marketing activities tourism service providers can reasonably study the tourism market predict tourist demand and better provide tourism services tourism big data includes tourists basic characteristics travel preferences behavioral characteristics and many other features analyzing tourists behavior from various aspects classifying tourists and then predicting the visibility of tourism marketing thus realizing precision market the basic features of tourists mainly include their gender age economic income education level and so on behavioral characteristics are tourists chosen travel methods travel motives and so on tourist preferences are made in food and accommodation and transportation preference for tourism suppliers and agents tourism big data help us to effectively identify tourists explore potential consumers and then proceed with tourism marketing in the process of tourism for the loss of customers and those rates of satisfaction tourism data can be used to investigated the reasons such as taking online reviews tracking complete records that we can find the problems of tourist attractions and correct them in time to find and develop points of interest in tourism to improve the risk of tourist satisfaction thus use that in tourism data to analyze various attributes and behavioral preferences it is possible to achieve accurate targeting of tourist sources in the market tourism data is also beneficial for tourists and analyzing the data for tourists and providing personalized travel plans it can provide a better service to tourists now the tourists demands have become the goal of the tourism market and the diversified and personalized tourists needs to drive tourism market changes tourists can also obtain information about exceptions through tourism data including weather accommodation traffic conditions and tourism programs and so on tourists can make choices based on the ratings of attractions utilizing the tourism
